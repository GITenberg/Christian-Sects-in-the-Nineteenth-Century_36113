<p>The following letters grew out of a conversation between one
of the editors of the &ldquo;Small Books,&rdquo; and a lady of
his acquaintance; and as there are probably many who have felt
the want of the information they contain, it has been thought
that by publishing them in a collected form they may be

in the letters themselves.&nbsp; All lament the small sum of
Christian charity to be found among religionists in general, but
few when they begin to write have kept clear of a severity of
comment which but prolongs differences.&nbsp; The writer, himself
a member of the Church of England, is anxious to show that it is
possible to be attached <a name="pagevi"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. vi</span>to one persuasion without imputing
either folly or ill intention to others; and it is with a view of
promoting the loving fellowship of all whom God disdains not to
create and support, that this slight sketch is given to the
world.</p>

<h2><a name="page1"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 1</span>LETTER
I.</h2>
<p>You some time ago requested me to give you the result of my
inquiries into the tenets of the different religious sects which
I had been acquainted with; and respecting which we had at
different times conversed.&nbsp; In the time which has since
elapsed I have been endeavouring, both to ascertain them more
completely, and to compare them with what I conceive to be the
true spirit of Christianity; but the subject has so grown as I
proceeded, that even now I can only give you a very short, and I
fear, in some cases, an imperfect notion of them.&nbsp; Yet the
subject is one of deep interest; and as I feel convinced that if
we looked a little closer into the differences between the
established church and those who separate from it, both parties
would find them smaller and less important than <a
name="page2"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 2</span>they imagine,
and that Christian charity would be increased by the examination,
I do not shrink from the task however inadequately I may execute
it.</p>
<p>I propose therefore to show you by extracts from the works of
the principal writers among the different religious sects, how
they all agree in most of the fundamental doctrines of
Christianity; at the same time that I point out the evil
consequences which I conceive would ensue were some of their
tenets <i>fully carried out</i> into practice: and also to state
wherein their peculiar opinions appear to me to be opposed to
&ldquo;the truth as it is in Christ Jesus,&rdquo; so far as to
prevent me from adopting them; though I can fully believe that
those who hold these opinions in the abstract, may,
notwithstanding, be excellent practical Christians.</p>
<p>Firmly attached as I am to the Church of England, whose form
of worship (allowing for the imperfections which naturally cling
to all human institutions), I consider preferable to any other; I
can still see much to admire in other persuasions and other
ceremonies, mixed up, though it be, with some imperfections and
error; and my love to the established church does not blind me to
some matters which might <a name="page3"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 3</span>be better otherwise, and which I shall
point out as I proceed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of all the Christian graces,&rdquo; says a quaint
writer, &ldquo;zeal is the most apt to turn sour;&rdquo; and the
observation is no less true than it is sad, for men too seldom
remember that they must add to their faith knowledge, and that
both are of no avail without the crowning gift of charity, <a
name="citation3"></a><a href="#footnote3"
class="citation">[3]</a> or in other words, brotherly love for
all mankind.&nbsp; The real Christian, it seems to me, should
imitate the liberality of St. Paul, who, after having been bred
up in the habits of the &ldquo;strictest sect&rdquo; of the Jews,
scrupled not to quit all his former prejudices, in order to
preach Christ to the Gentiles, without disgusting them by
ceremonies which were no fundamental part of the religion he
taught, and was content to become &ldquo;as a Jew, that he might
gain the Jews, and to them that were without law, to become as <a
name="page4"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 4</span>without law
(being not without law to God), that he might by all means save
some.&rdquo; <a name="citation4"></a><a href="#footnote4"
class="citation">[4]</a></p>
<p>We are too apt to hold each other accountable for all the
consequences which can be logically deduced from an opinion,
however extreme they may be: and then having persuaded ourselves
that those abstract tenets which, by straining them to an extreme
point, <i>may</i> have an evil effect, <i>must</i> have an evil
effect on all who profess them,&mdash;we avoid those who differ
from us on religious subjects, because we have assumed that they
are actually immoral by virtue of their opinions; and thus we
miss the opportunity of convincing ourselves of our mistake by a
more intimate knowledge of their lives.&nbsp; &ldquo;By their
fruits ye shall know them,&rdquo; says our Lord; but we seldom
approach them closely enough to see the fruits.</p>
<p>If we would be content to sink minor differences, and be
satisfied that &ldquo;in every nation he that feareth God and
worketh righteousness is accepted with him,&rdquo; we should soon
meet on better terms; for we do not hold at a distance from those
on earth whom we expect to meet in heaven; and thanks be to God,
there <a name="page5"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 5</span>is no
religious persuasion that cannot boast of many such as
Cornelius.</p>
<p>St. Paul recommends to the churches that they be &ldquo;kindly
affectioned one towards another, in honour preferring one
another:&rdquo; <a name="citation5a"></a><a href="#footnote5a"
class="citation">[5a]</a> &ldquo;by this shall men know that ye
are my disciples,&rdquo; says our Great Exemplar, &ldquo;if ye
have love one to another;&rdquo; but alas! if we contemplate what
is called the Christian world, where shall we find Christ&rsquo;s
<i>true</i> disciples?&nbsp; Grievous indeed it is, as has been
well observed, that that religion, which &ldquo;should most
correct and sweeten men&rsquo;s spirits, sours and sharpens them
the most.&rdquo;&nbsp; But surely &ldquo;<i>we</i> have not so
learned Christ.&rdquo;&nbsp; Let us for a moment contemplate His
conduct towards those who differed from him in religious
opinions; his compassion towards them; his meek reproofs not only
to the Sadducees and the Samaritans, but even to the more
hardened; <a name="citation5b"></a><a href="#footnote5b"
class="citation">[5b]</a> <a name="page6"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 6</span>and then let us turn to our own hearts
and confess with shame that we have fallen miserably short of
that charity without which &ldquo;whosoever liveth is counted
dead before God.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So clear is the command to exercise universal benevolence,
that whatever obscurity there may be in other parts of Scripture,
however men, even wise ones, may differ as to the real
signification of certain passages in the Bible, <i>here</i> at
least there can be no cavilling.&nbsp; It is intelligible to the
most ignorant as well as the most learned, so that &ldquo;the
wayfaring man, though a fool, shall not err therein.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Archbishop Tillotson relates of Mr. Gouge, an eminent
nonconformist, that he allowed men to differ from him in opinions
that were &ldquo;<i>very dear</i> to him;&rdquo; and provided men
did but &ldquo;fear God and work righteousness,&rdquo; he loved
them heartily, how distant soever from him in judgment about
things less necessary: &ldquo;in all <a name="page7"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 7</span>which,&rdquo; observes the Archbishop,
&ldquo;he is very worthy to be a pattern to men of all
persuasions.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;I abhor two principles in
religion,&rdquo; says William Penn in a letter to the same
archbishop, &ldquo;and pity them that own them.&nbsp; The first
is obedience upon authority without conviction; and the other,
destroying them that differ from me for God&rsquo;s sake: such a
religion is without judgment, though not without truth.&nbsp;
Union is best, if right; if not, charity.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I have given the opinion of these two eminent men of different
persuasions, partly to show that the evil I complain of is one of
long standing; partly to justify my own opinion as to the remedy;
namely, the paying <i>more</i> attention to the fundamental
doctrines of Christianity; <i>less</i>, to those minor
differences which, from the very obscurity of the texts on which
they are founded, come more frequently under discussion, and
thus, from a mental operation somewhat analogous to that of the
laws of perspective, seem large and important because they are
close under our eyes, though they are in fact minute in
comparison with those which we have not been examining so
closely.&nbsp; Thus men inadvertently reverse the order of
things, and zeal for the maintenance of peculiar tenets too often
supersedes <a name="page8"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
8</span>the far more important virtue of Christian benevolence,
to the scandal of all good Christians and the mockery of
unbelievers.</p>
<p>The Quakers, in their address to James II. on his accession,
told him that they understood he was no more of the established
religion than themselves.&nbsp; &ldquo;We therefore hope,&rdquo;
said they, &ldquo;that thou wilt allow us that liberty which thou
takest thyself:&rdquo; and it would be well if we took a hint
from this, and reflected that we differ as much from other sects
as they do from us, <a name="citation8"></a><a href="#footnote8"
class="citation">[8]</a> and that the greatest heresy is, as a
Christian Father declared it to be long ago&mdash;&ldquo;a wicked
life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It is, however, needful to distinguish between the Christian
spirit of forbearance towards those who differ from us in
religious opinions, which <a name="page9"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 9</span>Christ and his apostles so strongly
inculcate, and the indolent latitudinarianism which induces many
to declare that &ldquo;a man cannot help his belief,&rdquo; that
&ldquo;sincerity is everything,&rdquo; that &ldquo;all religious
sects are alike,&rdquo; &amp;c.: positions which, as you well
observed on one occasion, ought rather to be reversed; for when
men are <i>not</i> sincere, all sects certainly <i>are</i> alike:
for then it is but a lip service which will never influence the
life, and it matters not what opinion is professed; it will be
equally powerless.</p>
<p>Sincere belief must be the consequence of proof, without which
we cannot believe truly; with it, we must.&nbsp; If then we
content ourselves with the mere <i>ipse dixit</i> of others
without seeking proof, our belief is the result of indolence, <a
name="page10"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 10</span>and for that
indolence we shall be accountable when we are called on to give
an account of the talent committed to our charge, if error has
been consequent upon it.&nbsp; He, on the contrary, whose
education or whose means have not put proof within his reach,
although he may wish earnestly for it, <i>may</i> be wrong in
understanding, but he will never be wrong in heart: his tenets
may be wrong, but his life will be right.&nbsp; It behoves us
therefore to be cautious how we pass sentence on one another in
religious matters, since, as has been well observed, we are
ourselves amenable to a tribunal where uncharitable conduct
towards others, will bring down a just and heavy sentence on
ourselves.&nbsp; We are not to erect ourselves into judges of
other men&rsquo;s consciences, <a name="citation10"></a><a
href="#footnote10" class="citation">[10]</a> but leave them to
the judgment and disposal of <span class="smcap">One</span> who
alone can see into the heart of men, and alone can ascertain the
real nature and ultimate consequence of all questions which admit
of &ldquo;doubtful disputation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There will be some danger of losing our way <a
name="page11"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 11</span>among the
almost numberless divisions and subdivisions of sects, which
present themselves as soon as we begin to consider the subject at
all narrowly.&nbsp; I therefore propose to simplify my task, and
make our course a little plainer, by adopting the two great
divisions into which the reformed churches may have been said to
have arranged themselves at the era of the Reformation, as a
foundation for the classification of Christian sects at
present.&nbsp; Calvin and Melancthon may be considered as the
prototypes and heads of these two divisions, which however they
may sometimes vary and sometimes intermingle, are continually
reproduced, because they are grounded upon two great natural
divisions of human kind, the stern and the gentle.&nbsp; My own
leaning is to the latter, because it appears to me most in
accordance with the spirit of that gospel whose great Promulgator
made universal benevolence the test of his disciples; but at the
same time I must acknowledge, and shall indeed prove before I
have done, that the sterner theoretical view may coexist in the
mind with a large share of true Christian charity and
benevolence.&nbsp; Be the abstract belief of the Christian what
it may, if he be really at heart a disciple, the example of his
mild Master will always influence <a name="page12"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 12</span>his life and feelings, and he will
tread in the steps of his Lord, even if his judgment should
sometimes have mistaken the true meaning of some of his
words.</p>
<p>These two views of the Divine dispensations towards man were
first arrayed in actual hostility at the Synod of Dort in 1618,
where the doctrines of James Arminius, professor of divinity in
the University of Leyden, who had followed the opinions of Luther
and Melancthon, were condemned, and those of the Calvinistic
church of Geneva affirmed.&nbsp; From that time the various sects
of the reformed church have generally been known as Arminian or
Calvinistic, according as they embraced the peculiar tenets of
either party on the subject of man&rsquo;s salvation: I shall
therefore thus distinguish the two classes into which I propose
to arrange them, though they may not follow out either in the
whole of their opinions.</p>

<h2><a name="page14"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 14</span>LETTER
II.<br />
<span class="GutSmall">QUAKERS.</span></h2>
<p>The sect which I have placed first upon my list, arose about
the middle of the seventeenth century, when a number of
individuals withdrew from the communion of every <i>visible</i>
church &ldquo;to seek,&rdquo; <a name="citation14"></a><a
href="#footnote14" class="citation">[14]</a> as they expressed
it, &ldquo;the Lord, in retirement:&rdquo; and George Fox, their
leader, or as they termed him, their &ldquo;honourable
elder,&rdquo; went about preaching their opinions in fairs and
markets, in courts of justice, and steeple houses, i.e.
churches.&nbsp; He denounced the state worship as
&ldquo;superstitious,&rdquo; and warned all to obey the Holy
Spirit, speaking by him.&nbsp; He was in consequence brought
before two justices of the peace in Derbyshire in 1650, one of
whom, Mr. Bennet, called Fox, and his hearers
&ldquo;Quakers,&rdquo; in derision of their frequent admonitions
to &ldquo;<i>tremble</i> at the Word of God;&rdquo; <a
name="page15"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 15</span>and this
appellation soon became general, though they themselves took
then, and still preserve, the title of &ldquo;the Society of
Friends.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The rigid peculiarities of phrase, &amp;c. which Fox added to
his religious sentiments; the regular discipline which he
enforced; and the zeal with which he maintained and propagated
his tenets gave consistency to this sect, although he was not, as
has been supposed, the originator of their doctrines.&nbsp; He
conceived himself forbidden by divine command to pull off his hat
to any one, or to address any one excepting in the singular
number, or to &ldquo;call any man master;&rdquo; and for these
peculiarities as well as for the refusal to give or accept titles
of honour, or to take an oath, the &ldquo;Friends&rdquo; suffered
the most cruel persecutions; for we are told that &ldquo;they
tortured with cruel whippings the bodies of both men and women of
good estate and reputation;&rdquo; <a name="citation15a"></a><a
href="#footnote15a" class="citation">[15a]</a> and were further
punished by impounding of their horses; by distress of goods; by
fines, imprisonments, whipping, and setting in the stocks: <a
name="citation15b"></a><a href="#footnote15b"
class="citation">[15b]</a> yet, notwithstanding these severities,
<a name="page16"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 16</span>the sect
increased and spread far and wide, and great numbers of people
were drawn together, many out of animosity, to hear them.</p>
<p>The Declaration of Indulgence in 1663 stopped for a short time
the persecution of the Quakers, but by the Conventicle Act of
1664, numbers of them were condemned to transportation: in 1666,
however, their condition improved, when the celebrated William
Penn, the son of Admiral Penn, joined them.</p>
<p>The discipline of this society is kept up by monthly meetings,
composed of an aggregate of several particular congregations,
whose business it is to provide for the maintenance of their
poor, and the education of their children; also to judge of the
sincerity and fitness of persons desirous of being admitted as
members; to direct proper attention to religion and moral duty;
and to deal with disorderly members.&nbsp; At each monthly
meeting persons are appointed to see that the rules of their
discipline are put in practice.&nbsp; It is usual when any member
has misconducted himself, to appoint a small committee to visit
the offender, to endeavour to convince him of his error and
induce him to forsake it.&nbsp; If they succeed, he is declared
to have &ldquo;made satisfaction for his offence,&rdquo;
otherwise he is dismissed <a name="page17"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 17</span>from the society.&nbsp; In disputes
between individuals, it is enjoined that the members of this sect
should not sue each other at law, but settle their differences by
the rules of the society.</p>
<p>Marriage is regarded by the Quakers as a religious, not a mere
civil compact.&nbsp; Those who wish to enter into that state
appear together, and state their intentions at one of the monthly
meetings, and if not attended by parents or guardians must
produce their consent in writing duly witnessed; and if no
objections are raised at a subsequent meeting, they are allowed
to solemnize their marriage, which is done at a public meeting
for worship; towards the close of which the parties stand up and
solemnly take each other for man and wife.&nbsp; A certificate of
the proceedings is then read publicly and signed by the parties,
and afterwards by the relations as witnesses.&nbsp; The monthly
meeting keeps a register of the marriages as well as of the
births and burials of the society.</p>
<p>Children are named without any attending ceremony; neither is
it held <i>needful</i> that there should be any at burial, though
the body followed by the relatives and friends is sometimes
carried into a meeting house, and at the grave a <a
name="page18"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 18</span>pause is
generally made to allow of a discourse from any friend attending
if he be so inclined.</p>
<p>The women have monthly, quarterly, and yearly meetings of
their own sex, but without the power of making rules.&nbsp;
&ldquo;As we believe,&rdquo; they say, &ldquo;that women may be
rightly called to the work of the ministry, we also think that to
them belongs a share in the support of Christian discipline; and
that some parts of it wherein their own sex is concerned devolve
on them with peculiar propriety.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But what, you will ask, are the religious tenets of this
sect?&nbsp; The question will perhaps best be answered by an
extract from their &ldquo;Rules of Discipline,&rdquo; a work
published under the sanction of the society.&nbsp; &ldquo;The
original and immediate ground of the religious fellowship of the
early Friends,&rdquo; says the writer of this manual, &ldquo;was
<i>union of sentiment in regard to Christ&rsquo;s inward
teaching</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; They were firm believers in all that
is revealed in Holy Scripture respecting our Lord and Saviour
Jesus Christ; nor would they have allowed that any one held the
truth who denied his coming in the flesh, or the benefit to
fallen man by his propitiatory sacrifice.&nbsp; &ldquo;We believe
that, in order to enable mankind to put in practice the precepts
of the gospel, every <a name="page19"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 19</span>man coming into the world is endued
with a measure of the light, grace, or good Spirit of Christ, by
which, as it is alluded to, he is enabled to distinguish good
from evil, and to correct the disorderly passions and corrupt
propensities of his fallen nature, which <i>mere reason</i> is
altogether insufficient to overcome.&nbsp; For all that belongs
to man is fallible, and within the reach of temptation: but the
divine grace, which comes by Him, i.e. Christ, who hath overcome
the world, is, to those who humbly and sincerely seek it, an
all-sufficient and present help in time of need . . . whereby the
soul is translated out of the kingdom of darkness, and from under
the power of Satan into the marvellous light and kingdom of the
Son of God.&nbsp; Now as we thus believe that the grace of God,
which comes by Jesus Christ, is alone sufficient for salvation,
we can neither admit that it is conferred upon a few only, while
others are left without it; nor thus asserting its universality,
can we limit its operation to a partial cleansing of the soul
from sin even in this life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Baptism and the Lord&rsquo;s supper are regarded by this sect
as mere types or shadows, representing in a figurative manner
certain great particulars of Christian Truths, but not intended
<a name="page20"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 20</span>to be of
permanent obligation.&nbsp; They consider the former to have been
superseded by the baptism of the Spirit: of the latter they say,
&ldquo;the emblem may be either used or disused as Christians may
consider most conducive to the real advantage of the church: the
only <i>needful</i> supper of the Lord is altogether of a
spiritual nature.&rdquo;&nbsp; They conceive that a reliance on
the eucharist as a &lsquo;viaticum or saving ordinance,&rsquo; is
a dangerous tenet, as well as the connecting the rite of baptism
with regeneration.&nbsp; They think that &ldquo;ordinances so
liable to abuse, and the cause of so many divisions and
persecutions, cannot truly appertain to the law of
God.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Quakers consider all holidays as &ldquo;shadows&rdquo; which
ceased with the shadowy dispensations of the law, and that
neither the first day of the week, nor any other, possesses any
superior sanctity; <a name="citation20"></a><a href="#footnote20"
class="citation">[20]</a> but as a society they have never <a
name="page21"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 21</span>objected to
&ldquo;a day of rest,&rdquo; for the purpose of religious
improvement.&nbsp; They consider the Christian Dispensation to
have superseded the use of oaths, and contend that our
Lord&rsquo;s precepts <a name="citation21"></a><a
href="#footnote21" class="citation">[21]</a>extend even to the
swearing of witnesses in courts of law.&nbsp; War they hold to be
altogether inconsistent with the spirit and precepts of the
gospel, and urge that the primitive Christians during two
centuries maintained its unlawfulness.&nbsp; They object on the
same principle to capital punishments, and the slave trade.</p>
<p>The members of the society are bound by their principles to
abstain entirely &ldquo;from profane and extravagant
entertainments,&rdquo; from excess in eating and drinking; from
public diversions; from the reading of useless, frivolous, and
pernicious books; from gaming of every description; and from vain
and injurious sports (such as hunting or shooting for diversion);
from unnecessary display in funerals, furniture, and style of
living: from unprofitable, seductive, and dangerous amusements,
among which are ranked dancing and music; and generally <a
name="page22"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 22</span>from all
&ldquo;such occupations of time and mind as plainly tend to
levity, vanity, and forgetfulness of our God and Saviour,&rdquo;
and they object to all complimentary intercourse.</p>
<p>In the sketch I have now given of the tenets of this sect, you
cannot have failed to observe how closely their notions with
regard to the fundamental doctrines of Christianity tally with
those of the great body of the church; the differences being all
on points of minor import, if we except the ceremonies of baptism
and the Lord&rsquo;s supper; which, being the appointment of
Christ himself, we are not at liberty to reject.&nbsp; And yet,
be it observed, the Quaker does not presumptuously reject them,
but merely acts upon, as we suppose, an erroneous view of their
nature.</p>
<p>On points of minor difference it may be observed, that He who
was the <span class="smcap">Prince of Peace</span>, and came to
establish it, never specifically forbad war, (for there may be
cases where it is merely self defence,) but left it to the spirit
of the gospel to remove the <i>causes</i> of war. <a
name="citation22"></a><a href="#footnote22"
class="citation">[22]</a>&nbsp; We <a name="page23"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 23</span>all know the appellation bestowed on
the Centurion, Cornelius: and when soldiers came to John the
Baptist saying, &ldquo;What shall we do?&rdquo; he merely sought
to retrench the disorders and injustice which those who follow
the profession of arms might be tempted to commit; but did not
condemn their necessary employments.&nbsp; We may therefore
fairly conclude that the sweeping condemnation of <i>all</i> war
by the Quakers, is not warranted by Scripture, although it is in
many and indeed most instances, entered upon far too
carelessly.</p>
<p>One of the main distinctions of the Quakers is the rejection
of certain amusements and pursuits, which others on the contrary
consider as innocent, believing that the religion of Christ
rather encourages than forbids a cheerful spirit, and allows by
the example of the Saviour, a <a name="page24"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 24</span>participation in social pleasures:
and that &ldquo;an upright, religious man, by partaking in such
pleasures, may be the means of restraining others within due
bounds, and by his very presence may prevent their degenerating
into extravagance, profligacy, and sin;&rdquo; <a
name="citation24a"></a><a href="#footnote24a"
class="citation">[24a]</a> and such do not feel in their hearts
that <i>these</i> <a name="citation24b"></a><a
href="#footnote24b" class="citation">[24b]</a> are the
&ldquo;pomps and vanities of the world,&rdquo; which by their
baptismal vow they renounce.&nbsp; But surely it is possible that
different persons may regard the same pursuits and amusements in
a very different light, and yet both may be conscientious in
their views, and both, whether in abstaining or enjoying, be
equally doing that which is lawful <a name="page25"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 25</span>and right in the sight of God.&nbsp;
That very amusement or pursuit which is a snare to one, and
therefore to be avoided by him, may be a source of innocent, and
perhaps profitable recreation to another.&nbsp; It is the
intention, the <i>animus</i> with which an act is done, and not
the act itself which constitutes the sin.&nbsp; &ldquo;Let not
him that eateth despise him that eateth not; and let not him that
eateth not judge him that eateth: to his own master he standeth
or falleth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Christianity,&rdquo; says an excellent prelate of our
church, &ldquo;forbids no necessary occupation, no reasonable
indulgences, no innocent relaxation.&nbsp; <a
name="page26"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 26</span>It allows us
to &lsquo;use&rsquo; the world, provided we do not
&lsquo;abuse&rsquo; it.&nbsp; It does not spread before us a
delicious banquet, and then come with a &lsquo;Touch not, taste
not, handle not:&rsquo; all it requires is that our liberty
degenerate not into licentiousness; our amusements into
dissipation; our industry into incessant toil; our carefulness
into extreme anxiety and endless solicitude.&nbsp; When it
requires us to be &lsquo;temperate in all things,&rsquo; it
plainly tells us that we <i>may</i> use all things temperately.
<a name="citation26"></a><a href="#footnote26"
class="citation">[26]</a>&nbsp; When it directs us to &lsquo;make
our moderation known unto all men,&rsquo; this evidently implies
that within the bounds of moderation we may enjoy all the
reasonable conveniences and comforts of this present
life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I have noticed this, in my opinion, erroneous practice of the
Quakers at the more length, because it is not confined to
them.&nbsp; Asceticism, of which this is one branch, has been the
bane of the church and of Christianity generally; and few sects
are entirely free from the notion that holiness requires a
withdrawal from amusements, and a certain degree of seclusion
from the world.&nbsp; Yet, if the world is to be <a
name="page27"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 27</span>improved, the
leaven must be placed <i>in</i> it; and a good man probably never
does his Father&rsquo;s work more effectually than when he
spreads the sanctifying influence of his example through all the
relations of life; showing that there is no position in society
where Christianity does not add a grace and a relish unknown
without it: spreading refinement of manners and delicacy of
thought, and insensibly rendering social intercourse more
polished, and more delightful, by banishing from it all that can
offend.</p>
<p>The Quakers adduce Matt. v. 33&ndash;37, James v. 12, &amp;c.
in support of their objection to all oaths, even judicial ones,
and consider that the Christian dispensation abrogated their
use.&nbsp; But in answer to this we may observe that even the
Almighty is represented as confirming his promises by a solemn
oath.&nbsp; &ldquo;Because,&rdquo; says the apostle, &ldquo;He
could swear by no higher, He sware by Himself;&rdquo; and St.
Paul on particular occasions expresses himself thus, &ldquo;As
God is true:&rdquo; &ldquo;Before God I lie not:&rdquo;
&ldquo;God is my record,&rdquo; &amp;c. all which expressions
undoubtedly contain the essence and formality of an oath; and the
Apostle upon some occasions mentions this solemn swearing with
approbation, &ldquo;an oath for confirmation is the end of all
strife:&rdquo; <a name="page28"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
28</span>the swearing, therefore, which our Saviour absolutely
forbids, is common or unnecessary swearing, and we are
recommended to affirm or deny in common conversation without
imprecations.&nbsp; &ldquo;Let your conversation be yea,
yea,&mdash;nay, nay.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The repugnance entertained by the Quakers against paying
tithes appears to me to arise from an error in their mode of
viewing the question.&nbsp; The assertion made by them
&ldquo;that all the provision made for ministers of the gospel in
the first ages was made by the love of their flocks,&rdquo; is
true, though that love very soon produced endowments, even before
Christianity was established as the law of the empire.&nbsp; But
allowing this, it does not follow, as they go on to assert, that
&ldquo;since we are under the same dispensation of love as the
Apostles were, the principles which governed the church then are
to govern it now.&rdquo;&nbsp; Tithes were originally given to
the church as a corporation, by the owners of the soil; and since
that time estates have been transferred from hand to hand subject
to that charge, till no man has any plea for refusing it.&nbsp;
The question is not one of religion but of property.&nbsp; If my
estate devolve to me chargeable with an annuity payable either to
a corporation <a name="page29"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
29</span>or an individual, I have no right to set up his
religious opinions in bar of his claim: for I have paid less for
the purchase in consequence of the existence of that claim, which
in common honesty therefore I am bound to satisfy, be the
annuitant who he may. <a name="citation29"></a><a
href="#footnote29" class="citation">[29]</a></p>
<p>Having now noticed the points wherein I consider the peculiar
tenets of the Quakers to be erroneous, I shall conclude with the
more agreeable part of my task, and prove by extracts from one of
their writers how much of true Christian feeling exists among
them.&nbsp; The following is from a little book given me by a
Quaker, from the pen of J. Gurney, entitled &ldquo;An Essay on
Love to God.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page30"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
30</span>&ldquo;Still more completely than the provisions of
nature fall in with our bodily state, and supply our temporal
wants; still more properly than the air agrees with the functions
of the lungs, and the light with those of the eye, does the
gospel of our Redeemer suit the spiritual condition of man.&nbsp;
We are a fallen race, alienated from God by our sins, justly
liable to his wrath: in the gospel we have pardon, peace and
restoration.&nbsp; &lsquo;Christ made all things new,&rsquo; says
Grotius, &lsquo;and the latter creation is <i>more divine</i>
than the former.&rsquo;&nbsp; If then the first creation of
mankind and all the bounties of nature are the result of Love,
that attribute is far more gloriously displayed in the scheme of
redemption and in the works of grace.&mdash;The love of God the
Father is ever represented in Scripture as the origin of all our
hopes,&mdash;as the eternal, unfathomable spring of the waters of
life and salvation, and this love is plainly described as
extending to the whole world.&nbsp; &lsquo;God so loved the
world, &amp;c. <a name="citation30a"></a><a href="#footnote30a"
class="citation">[30a]</a>&nbsp; God was in Christ reconciling
the world to himself&rsquo; <a name="citation30b"></a><a
href="#footnote30b" class="citation">[30b]</a>&mdash;&lsquo;God
would have all men to be saved, &amp;c.&rsquo; <a
name="citation30c"></a><a href="#footnote30c"
class="citation">[30c]</a>&nbsp; Do we ask for an overwhelming <a
name="page31"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 31</span>evidence of
the love of God?&nbsp; Let the Apostle satisfy our inquiry.&nbsp;
&lsquo;In this was manifested the love of God towards us, because
God sent his only begotten Son into the world that we might live
by him.&nbsp; Herein is love; not that we loved God, but that he
loved us, and sent his Son to be the propitiation for our
sins.&rsquo; <a name="citation31a"></a><a href="#footnote31a"
class="citation">[31a]</a>&nbsp; Do we ask whether God thus loved
the whole or only a part of the world?&mdash;Let the same Apostle
answer: &lsquo;He tasted death for <i>every man</i>&mdash;He gave
himself a ransom for <i>all</i>, &amp;c.&rsquo;&nbsp; Even the
Gentiles, who were without the benefit of an outward revelation,
were by no means destitute of an inward knowledge of the law of
God, and some of them showed &lsquo;the work of the law written
on their hearts, their consciences also bearing witness.&rsquo;
<a name="citation31b"></a><a href="#footnote31b"
class="citation">[31b]</a>&nbsp; &lsquo;Christ is the true light
which lighteth every man that cometh into the world.&rsquo; <a
name="citation31c"></a><a href="#footnote31c"
class="citation">[31c]</a>&nbsp; Hence we may reasonably infer
that as God appointed the death of Christ to be a sacrifice for
the sins of the <i>whole</i> world, so <i>all</i> men receive
through Christ a measure of moral and spiritual light, and all
have their day of gracious visitation.&nbsp; If the light in
numberless <a name="page32"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
32</span>instances be extremely faint, if the darkness fail to
comprehend it, we may rest in the conviction that God is not only
just but equitable, and that those &lsquo;who know not their
Master&rsquo;s will and do it not shall be beaten with few
stripes.&rsquo; <a name="citation32"></a><a href="#footnote32"
class="citation">[32]</a>&nbsp; The gospel of our Lord Jesus
Christ, as it is revealed in the Holy Scriptures, is intended for
the benefit of the whole world: it is adapted to men of every
condition, clime, and character: all are invited to avail
themselves of its benefits: all who <i>will</i> come <i>may</i>
come, and &lsquo;take the water of life freely.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<h2><a name="page33"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 33</span>LETTER
III.<br />
<span class="GutSmall">SOCINIANS AND UNITARIANS.</span></h2>
<p>When the first great movement which led to the Reform of a
large part of the Christian Churches in Europe, awakened
men&rsquo;s minds from the lethargy in which they had slept
whilst learning was confined to the cloister, the questions with
regard to the nature of the Deity which had distracted the early
church began again to be mooted; and as early as the year 1524,
&ldquo;the divinity of Christ was openly denied by Lewis Hetyer,
one of the wandering and fanatical Anabaptists, who was put to
death at Constance.&rdquo; <a name="citation33a"></a><a
href="#footnote33a" class="citation">[33a]</a>&nbsp; He was
succeeded by Michael Servede or Servetus, a Spanish physician;
who, for his wild notions on the same subject, was apprehended on
his road through Switzerland at the instigation of Calvin,
accused of blasphemy, and condemned to the flames. <a
name="citation33b"></a><a href="#footnote33b"
class="citation">[33b]</a>&nbsp; But <a name="page34"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 34</span>doctrines were never yet crushed by
persecution, unless indeed it were so wholesale as to exterminate
all who held them; and though these opinions were thus fatal to
their professors, the main points were reproduced by others; and
finally assumed form as a sect, under the titles above
named.&nbsp; The term Socinian was taken from two of its most
distinguished promoters, L&aelig;lius and Faustus Sozinus, or
Socinus.&nbsp; They were of an illustrious family at Siena in
Tuscany, and L&aelig;lius, the uncle of Faustus, having taken a
disgust to popery, travelled into France, England, &amp;c. to
examine into their religious creed, in order, if possible, to
come at the truth.&nbsp; He was a man distinguished for his
genius and learning, no less than for his virtuous life; he
settled at last at Zurich, embraced the Helvetic confession of
faith, and died at Zurich in 1562, before he had reached his
fortieth year.&nbsp; His sentiments, or rather doubts as to
certain points, were embodied, and more openly propagated by his
nephew Faustus; who, as is supposed, drew up from his papers the
religious system afterwards known under the name of
Socinianism.&nbsp; There is however a considerable degree of
obscurity hanging over the rise of this sect, and no one has
given a satisfactory history of it.</p>
<p><a name="page35"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 35</span>The
first appearance of Unitarians, as a distinct congregation, was
in Poland, where they obtained a settlement in the city of Cracow
in the year 1569; and in 1575 they published at Cracow the
&ldquo;Catechism or Confession of the Unitarians;&rdquo; <a
name="citation35a"></a><a href="#footnote35a"
class="citation">[35a]</a> but Faustus Socinus having settled
among them in the year 1579, soon obtained so much influence as
finally to remodel the whole religious system of the sect, and a
new form drawn up by Socinus himself, was substituted for the old
Catechism.</p>
<p>The following is an abstract of the doctrines taught in this
Catechism.&nbsp; After affirming that the Christian religion is
&ldquo;a road for arriving at eternal life, divinely made
known,&rdquo; the pupil is told that the will of God on points
essential to salvation was revealed by Jesus Christ.&nbsp; The
Catechism then goes on to affirm the entire unity of the Deity;
since if he is one essence, then must he also be individually
one, <a name="citation35b"></a><a href="#footnote35b"
class="citation">[35b]</a> and <a name="page36"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 36</span>therefore Christ cannot he truly said
to be a <i>separate</i> person or individual, partaking of the
<i>essentia</i> of the Deity, since that <i>essentia</i> is
necessarily one.&nbsp; That the Spirit of God, being an essential
part of the Deity, cannot be a separate individual (for in this
sense the Catechism interprets the word <i>persona</i> <a
name="citation36"></a><a href="#footnote36"
class="citation">[36]</a>), any more than his wisdom or his
goodness is a separate individual, and that therefore the
manifestations of the Spirit of God are manifestations of the
Deity himself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Christ,&rdquo; says the Catechism, &ldquo;is a man,
according to Rom. v. 15, conceived by a virgin, through the power
of the Divine Spirit, without the intervention of man in the
ordinary course of generation.&nbsp; He was first subject to
suffering and death&mdash;afterwards impassible and immortal,
Rom. vi. 9.&nbsp; It is in the sense of his existence derived
immediately from God, that he, though man, is called the Son of
God&mdash;as Adam is so <a name="page37"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 37</span>termed from the same cause.&nbsp;
Jesus Christ was the immediate instrument of God&rsquo;s
communications to man; and being, whilst on earth, the voice of
God, he is now the anointed King, or Christ, over the people of
God.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The passages where he is said to have existed from the
beginning: to have created all things, &amp;c. are laboriously
explained away, as referring to the regeneration, or new state of
things introduced by Christ&rsquo;s mission on earth: and in this
part there is much forced interpretation.&nbsp; I shall annex
some of the passages in the language of the original, <a
name="citation37"></a><a href="#footnote37"
class="citation">[37]</a> as a proof that I have given a fair
account of the real Socinian doctrine, which is very little
understood at present.&nbsp; Writers from whom we might expect
greater accuracy, have very generally confounded Socinians and
Arians, although Faustus Socinus was at the pains to write a
laboured refutation of the Arian doctrine, and although a
reference to the doctrines of the two sects would show that they
are the antipodes of each other.&nbsp; Arius taught that Christ
was not of <i>the same</i> nature
(&#8001;&mu;&omicron;&omicron;&#973;&sigma;&iota;&omicron;&sigmaf;),
with the Father, but of <i>a like</i> nature
(&#8001;&mu;&omicron;&iota;&omicron;&#973;&sigma;&iota;&omicron;&sigmaf;)
and therefore individually separate&mdash;separate in <a
name="page38"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 38</span>will, and
capable of differing.&nbsp; This is a direct assertion of two
Gods.&nbsp; Socinus on the contrary strenuously asserts the unity
of the Deity to the extent of denying the pre-existence of
Christ: which Arius though acknowledging that there was a time
when he began to exist, nevertheless refers to a period remote
beyond human calculation.&nbsp; Thus upon their characteristic
doctrines, the two sects are diametrically opposed to each
other.</p>
<p>Having now given you the real opinions of Socinus, from his
own works, for the book is lying beside me as I write, I shall
pursue my plan of examining how far they accord with what was
taught by those who certainly ought to be best informed on the
subject, namely, Christ himself, his Apostles, and their
immediate successors; as well as with the deductions of
reason.&nbsp; The unity of the Deity is so frequently and so
decidedly asserted in Scripture, that it is impossible to
consider any man as unorthodox who professes to make this the
groundwork of his belief&mdash;so far therefore the Socinian is
in accordance both with Scripture and the general voice of the
Christian church, for the early Apologists for Christianity, who
had to address polytheists, are full of declarations <a
name="page39"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 39</span>that they
worship One only Deity, who by various manifestations has made
himself, at different times, known to mankind. <a
name="citation39a"></a><a href="#footnote39a"
class="citation">[39a]</a>&nbsp; There is not a writer of the
first and second centuries who does not anxiously assert the
one-ness of the God whom the Christians worship: but then they as
anxiously assert the identity of their Teacher and Lord with that
God.&nbsp; From Christ himself, who says, &ldquo;Before Abraham
was, I am;&rdquo; <a name="citation39b"></a><a
href="#footnote39b" class="citation">[39b]</a> &ldquo;I and the
Father are one;&rdquo; <a name="citation39c"></a><a
href="#footnote39c" class="citation">[39c]</a> &ldquo;He who hath
seen me hath seen the Father;&rdquo; &ldquo;the Father that
dwelleth in me, He doeth the works;&rdquo; <a
name="citation39d"></a><a href="#footnote39d"
class="citation">[39d]</a> to St. Paul, who tells us that
&ldquo;God was in Christ reconciling the world to Himself,&rdquo;
<a name="citation39e"></a><a href="#footnote39e"
class="citation">[39e]</a> down to the fathers of the early
church, to whom I may refer <i>passim</i> for the same doctrine;
all have distinctly asserted that the message of peace to man was
delivered by God himself, making use of a human form as the mode
of communication with his creatures, and dwelling in &ldquo;the
man Christ Jesus,&rdquo; <a name="citation39f"></a><a
href="#footnote39f" class="citation">[39f]</a> as in a temple
built up for his especial use; the human nature, <a
name="page40"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 40</span>to use the
expression of the church, &ldquo;having been taken into
God,&rdquo; not the Godhead circumscribed in man.&nbsp; I will
not swell the length of my letter with quotations from the
fathers which may be found elsewhere; I think the texts I have
quoted with many more of the same purport, which you will readily
call to mind, suffice to prove that when Socinus asserted the
Christ to be <i>merely</i> a man, he erred; for though Jesus
&ldquo;the Carpenter&rsquo;s son,&rdquo; as his contemporaries
called him, was to all intents and purposes a man &ldquo;of a
reasonable soul and human flesh subsisting;&rdquo; <a
name="citation40"></a><a href="#footnote40"
class="citation">[40]</a> and though this may be proved from
numberless passages in the Scripture, where the man Jesus speaks
of his inferiority to the Father and bestower of his human frame
and spirit,&mdash;yet if we do not entirely distort the meaning
of words, <i>that man</i> at times uttered declarations of divine
power which could only have proceeded from the indwelling Deity,
otherwise they must have been the assertions of imposture, which
Socinus by no means teaches to have been the case.&nbsp; I know
not, therefore, how the believer in the Gospel can avoid
acknowledging that Christ was a compound being:&mdash;<a
name="page41"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 41</span>perfectly a
man, and speaking as such on some occasions; but, at the same
time, the temple of the Ever-living God, whose words flowed from
his lips like the answer from the Mercy seat: &ldquo;Heaven and
the heaven of heavens&rdquo; no doubt &ldquo;cannot
contain&rdquo; the Infinite; and no true believer will assert
that God can be circumscribed in a human body&mdash;but, if so
mean a comparison may be permitted&mdash;as the crater of the
volcano is but the mouthpiece of the mighty agents operating
within for the fashioning of the earth,&mdash;so the
manifestation of the Deity in the form, and from the lips of a
man, is but that spot of the material creation where the ever
blessed Divinity allows himself, as it were, a vent; and gives
forth a visible and tangible sign of his existence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He that has seen me has seen the Father,&rdquo; says
<i>the Christ</i>.&nbsp; &ldquo;I can of my own self do
nothing&rdquo; <a name="citation41"></a><a href="#footnote41"
class="citation">[41]</a> says <i>the man</i>: and this
distinction which the Christ who necessarily knew something of
the composition of his own nature so frequently asserts, has
probably been the groundwork of the mistaken views of this class
of Christians, and we may well look with charitable <a
name="page42"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 42</span>indulgence on
the errors of men, who dreading lest they should incur the
penalty of giving the incommunicable glory of the Mighty God to
another, have not allowed their due weight to the passages, which
assert that Mighty God to have undertaken the task of bringing
his creature man back to Himself.</p>
<p>Having thus given you a fair account of the creed of Socinus,
I must next notice the modern Unitarians, who on some points
differ from him.&nbsp; Where there is no acknowledged creed or
catechism, <a name="citation42"></a><a href="#footnote42"
class="citation">[42]</a> which may be quoted as authority, it is
<a name="page43"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 43</span>difficult
to give the doctrines of a sect with any precision; but as far as
it is possible to judge from the writings most in repute among
the Unitarians, they disclaim the notion of the miraculous <a
name="page44"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 44</span>conception,
and believe Christ to have been to all intents and purposes <i>a
mere man</i>.&nbsp; At the same time they allow him to have been
so inspired and guided by God, that it is difficult to see where
they draw the line between their own creed and that of the
church, which allows the perfect humanity of Jesus, but asserts
that &ldquo;God and man make one Christ,&rdquo; namely, that the
message of peace was that of God speaking by human lips, and that
the Anointed prophet who declared it, was, when so anointed, the
temple and place of manifestation of the living God.&nbsp; They
disclaim the doctrine of atonement, <a name="page45"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 45</span>and believe that the mission of
Christ had for its object the reform of the world, and the
restoration of man to a sense of his true relation towards God,
and even here Scripture and the early church speak a language
which differs not very greatly from theirs.&nbsp; For the
language in which our redemption is spoken of, is that of a
master purchasing a slave, as will be seen on a reference to Rom.
vi. in the original.&nbsp; The ransom by which man was purchased
to be the servant of holiness instead of that of sin, was paid to
his former master, sin; by the purchaser; and the purchaser is
God.&nbsp; &ldquo;I speak after the manner of men,&rdquo; says
St. Paul, &ldquo;because of the infirmity of your flesh.&rdquo;
i.e. I adopt the phraseology of a common transaction because your
minds are not sufficiently accustomed to the contemplation of
higher things to understand them without a metaphor; but the
Unitarian forgets, when asserting that the ransom was not paid
<i>to</i> God, that it was paid <i>by</i> God: and that man, the
slave, was bought from sin, the master, at no less a price than
the condescension of the Deity himself to the infirmity of our
flesh, by making himself visibly and tangibly known to his
creatures, through the medium of a human form.</p>
<p><a name="page46"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 46</span>I have
now endeavoured to give a dispassionate view of the doctrines of
these sects, hitherto so much misunderstood, and having marked
the points wherein they appear to me to recede from Christian
truth, I have the pleasanter task before me, of showing by
extracts from their writings, how large a portion of the religion
which we all profess, they still retain, and I may say from
experience, on most occasions conscientiously act upon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If with the Apostle we glory in the cross of Christ, or
in that religion which could not have been confirmed without his
death, let us not only be careful to govern our lives by the
precepts of it in general, but more particularly be prepared to
suffer what the strictest profession of it may call us to.&nbsp;
Let us remember that our Saviour hath said, if any man will be
his disciple he must &ldquo;take up his cross, and follow
him.&rdquo;&nbsp; That is, he must be ready to do it rather than
abandon the profession of the Gospel, or whatever the strictest
purity of it may require.&nbsp; A true Christian is no more <i>of
this world</i> than his Lord and Master was of it.&nbsp; With him
every thing here below is but of secondary consideration,
&amp;c.&mdash;but this we must remember for our consolation, that
if, in time of persecution &ldquo;He that <a
name="page47"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 47</span>keepeth his
life shall lose it,&rdquo; &ldquo;He that loseth his life&rdquo;
for the profession of the Gospel &ldquo;shall keep it to life
eternal.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;If we suffer with Christ, we shall
also reign with him and be glorified together.&rdquo; <a
name="citation47"></a><a href="#footnote47"
class="citation">[47]</a></p>
<p>&ldquo;The truths which relate to Jesus himself are among the
<i>most important</i> which the Gospel reveals.&nbsp; &lsquo;We
preach Christ,&rsquo; says the Apostle, &lsquo;warning every man
and teaching every man, that we may present every man perfect in
Christ Jesus.&rsquo;&nbsp; From this passage we derive a most
important sentiment, confirmed by the whole New
Testament&mdash;that the great design of all the doctrines and
precepts of the Gospel, is, to exalt the character,&mdash;to
promote eminent purity of heart and life, to make men
&lsquo;perfect as their Father in heaven is perfect.&rsquo;&nbsp;
We must preach not to make fiery partizans, and to swell the
number of a sect; not to overwhelm the mind with fear, or to heat
it with feverish rapture; not to form men to the decencies of
life, to a superficial goodness, which will secure the admiration
of mankind.&nbsp; All these effects fall infinitely short of the
great end of <a name="page48"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
48</span>the Christian ministry.&nbsp; We should preach that we
may make men perfect Christians: perfect, not according to the
standard of the world, but according to the law of Christ;
perfect in heart and in life, in solitude and in society, in the
great and in the common concerns of life.&nbsp; Here is the
purpose of Christian preaching.&nbsp; In this, as in a common
centre, all the truths of the Gospel meet; to this they all
conspire; and no doctrine has an influence on salvation, any
farther than it is an aid to the perfecting of our nature.&rdquo;
<a name="citation48"></a><a href="#footnote48"
class="citation">[48]</a></p>
<p>&ldquo;Christ is a great Saviour, as he redeems or sets free
the mind, cleansing it from evil, breathing into it the love of
virtue, calling forth its noblest faculties and affections,
enduing it with moral power, restoring it to order, health and
liberty.&rdquo; * * * * &ldquo;Christ has revealed to us God as
the Father, and as a Father in the noblest sense of that
word.&nbsp; He hath revealed Him as the author and lover of all
souls, desiring to redeem all from sin, and to impress his
likeness more and more resplendently on all; as proffering to all
that best gift in the universe, his &lsquo;holy Spirit;&rsquo; as
having sent his beloved Son <a name="page49"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 49</span>to train us up and to introduce us to
an &lsquo;inheritance, incorruptible, undefiled, and unfading in
the heavens.&rsquo;&rdquo; <a name="citation49"></a><a
href="#footnote49" class="citation">[49]</a></p>
<p>&ldquo;I confess when I can escape the deadening power of
habit, and can receive the full import of such passages as the
following, &lsquo;Come unto me, all ye that labour and are heavy
laden, and I will give you rest.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;I am come to
seek and to save that which was lost.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;He that
confesseth me before men, him will I confess before my Father in
heaven.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;Whosoever shall be ashamed of me
before men, of him shall the Son of Man be ashamed, when he
cometh in the glory of the Father with the holy
angels.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;In my Father&rsquo;s house are many
mansions; I go to prepare a place for you;&rsquo; I say, when I
can succeed in realizing the import of such passages, I feel
myself listening to a being, such as never before and never since
spoke in human language.&nbsp; I am awed by the consciousness of
greatness which these simple words express; and when I connect
this greatness with the proofs of Christ&rsquo;s miracles which I
gave you in a former discourse, I am compelled to speak <a
name="page50"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 50</span>with the
Centurion, &lsquo;Truly this was the Son of God.&rsquo; <a
name="citation50a"></a><a href="#footnote50a"
class="citation">[50a]</a></p>
<p>&ldquo;In reading the Gospels I feel myself in the presence of
one who speaks as man never spake; whose voice is not of the
earth; who speaks with a tone of reality and authority altogether
his own; who speaks of God, as conscious of his immediate
presence, as enjoying with him the intimacy of an only Son; and
who speaks of heaven, as most familiar with the higher states of
being.&rdquo; <a name="citation50b"></a><a href="#footnote50b"
class="citation">[50b]</a></p>
<p>&ldquo;Go to Jesus Christ for guidance, inspiration, and
strength in your office.&rdquo; * * * &ldquo;The privilege of
communing with such a spirit is so great, and the duty of going
from man to Christ is so solemn, that you must spare no effort to
place yourself nearer and nearer to the Divine
Master.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;My brother, go forth to your labours
with the spirit and power of Him who first preached the Gospel to
the poor.&rdquo; <a name="citation50c"></a><a href="#footnote50c"
class="citation">[50c]</a></p>
<p>&ldquo;To Jesus the conqueror of death we owe the sure hope of
immortality.&rdquo; * * *&nbsp; &ldquo;Is that <a

scorned, who in the language of conscious greatness says to us,
&lsquo;I am the resurrection and the life&rsquo;?&rdquo; <a
name="citation51a"></a><a href="#footnote51a"
class="citation">[51a]</a></p>
<p>&ldquo;What are we to understand by the Divinity of
Christ?&nbsp; In the sense in which many Christians, and perhaps
a majority interpret it, we do not deny it, but believe it as
firmly as themselves.&nbsp; We believe firmly in the Divinity of
Christ&rsquo;s mission and office, that he spoke with Divine
authority, and was a bright image of the Divine
perfections.&nbsp; We believe that God dwelt in him, manifested
himself through him, taught men by him, and communicated to him
his spirit without measure.&nbsp; We believe that Jesus Christ
was the most glorious display, expression, and representative of
God to mankind, so that in seeing and knowing him, we see and
know the invisible Father; so that when Christ came, God visited
the world and dwelt with men more conspicuously than at any
former period.&nbsp; In Christ&rsquo;s words, we hear God
speaking; in his miracles, we behold God acting; in his character
and life, we see an unsullied image of God&rsquo;s purity and
love.&rdquo; <a name="citation51b"></a><a href="#footnote51b"

IV.<br />
<span class="GutSmall">WESLEYAN METHODISTS.</span></h2>
<p>Towards the beginning of the last century, two young men at
Oxford, the one a fellow of Lincoln College, struck by the
thoughtlessness or lukewarmness of those about them, resolved to
devote themselves to closer and more profitable study.&nbsp; They
were brothers, by name John and Charles Wesley; and two other
students joined them in their evening readings of the New
Testament in the Greek: the elder of the brothers was at this
time about twenty-six. <a name="citation52"></a><a
href="#footnote52" class="citation">[52]</a>&nbsp; After a year
of this kind of life, they admitted two or three of the pupils of
the elder brother, and one of those of the younger, to their
meetings; and the following year, being joined by yet more of the
students, the regularity of their lives obtained for them the
title of <i>Methodists</i> from those who were not inclined to
follow their example.</p>
<p><a name="page53"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 53</span>In 1735
another name was added to their number, which has also become
celebrated: this was George Whitfield of Pembroke College, then
in his eighteenth year; but of him I shall have occasion to speak
by and by.&nbsp; I shall therefore confine myself to the
Wesleys.&nbsp; A difference of opinion on the subjects of
Freewill and Predestination separated them from their younger
coadjutor in 1741, and their respective friends, adopting
strongly the distinctive opinions of the two, the grand division
of the sect, which sprung up from their preaching, into Wesleyan
or Arminian, and Whitfieldian or Calvinistic Methodists,
ensued.&nbsp; All three received holy orders according to the
ceremonial of the Church of England, and Wesley never ceased to
hold his spiritual mother in high estimation.&nbsp; &ldquo;The
Church of England,&rdquo; he says in one place, &ldquo;is the
purest in Christendom.&rdquo;&nbsp; But the singularity of their
proceedings raised suspicion, and though both brothers continued
to profess the fullest assent to the articles and liturgy of the
established church, yet their manner of preaching and form of
worship had something in it which led the bishops and clergy in
general to consider them as verging on Sectarianism.&nbsp; In
many places they were refused the <a name="page54"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 54</span>use of the pulpit; and then, in the
perhaps enthusiastic belief that they were the appointed
instruments of rekindling religion in hearts where it had been
dead hitherto, they began a system of field preaching.</p>
<p>There were at that time large districts slumbering in utter
darkness and ignorance of the saving truths of the Gospel: and it
was to these that the Wesleys especially directed their
attention, with a success proportioned to their zeal; and had the
then heads of the church availed themselves of the assistance of
these earnest men in the way they might have done, by sanctioning
their missionary labours among the poor and the uninstructed, the
benefit would have been incalculable.&nbsp; But the harsh
treatment <a name="citation54"></a><a href="#footnote54"
class="citation">[54]</a> <a name="page55"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 55</span>they met with, drove John Wesley at
last into complete schism: and then the ambition, which had
perhaps animated his first exertions almost unknown to himself,
assumed a bolder flight, and he aspired to the distinction of
being the head and leader of a sect which grew so rapidly, that
at the time of his death in 1791, &ldquo;the number of members in
connexion with him in Europe, America, and the West Indian
Islands, was 80,000.&nbsp; And at the last conference in 1831 the
numbers returned were, in Great Britain, 249,119; in Ireland,
22,470; in the Foreign Missions, 42,743.&nbsp; Total
314,332.&nbsp; Exclusive of more than half a million of persons
in the Societies in the States of America.&rdquo; <a
name="citation55"></a><a href="#footnote55"
class="citation">[55]</a></p>
<p>You are probably aware that, besides the public preaching,
Wesley instituted among his people several kinds of private
meetings.&nbsp; To the public prayer meetings, which were
generally held in private houses, persons not of this sect were
often invited, and on these occasions a hymn <a
name="page56"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 56</span>was first
sung, then they all knelt, and the first who felt
&ldquo;moved&rdquo; made an extempore prayer: when he had
finished, another commenced, and so on for about two hours.&nbsp;
These prayer meetings were held in such high esteem among the
Methodists, that they asserted more were &ldquo;born again&rdquo;
and &ldquo;made free,&rdquo; as they termed it, &ldquo;from all
the remains of sin&rdquo; than at any other meetings, public
preachings, &amp;c.</p>
<p>There was much in this kind of meeting which was likely to
lead to enthusiasm, which is universally found to be most easily
awakened where numbers are congregated; and according to an
author formerly of their persuasion, <a name="citation56"></a><a
href="#footnote56" class="citation">[56]</a> the consequence was
such as might have been expected.&nbsp; &ldquo;It is
impossible,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;to form any just idea of those
assemblies except you had been present at them.&nbsp; One coaxes
the Divine Being, another is amorous, and a third will tell the
Deity, &lsquo;He must be a liar if he does not grant all they
ask.&rsquo;&nbsp; They thus go on working up each other&rsquo;s
imagination until they become as it were spiritually intoxicated,
and while in this state they sometimes recollect a text or two <a
name="page57"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 57</span>of Scripture,
such as &lsquo;Thy sins are forgiven thee&rsquo;&mdash;&lsquo;Go
and sin no more&rsquo;&mdash;&lsquo;Go in peace,&rsquo; &amp;c.
and then declare themselves to be &lsquo;born again&rsquo; or
&lsquo;sanctified.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The love feast is also a private meeting of as many members of
the community as choose to attend; and they generally assemble
from all parts within several miles of the place where the feast
is held.&nbsp; They then alternately sing and pray, and some
among them, who think that their experience, as they term it, is
remarkable, stand up, and narrate all the transactions which they
say have taken place between God, the devil, and their souls.</p>
<p>There is a curious propensity to egotism in human nature which
frequently shews itself in religious matters.&nbsp; Men love to
talk of themselves: and the Romanist finds pleasure in the power
of pouring forth all his feelings and thoughts to his father
confessor, whenever he is strongly excited by passion: of this I
have become aware from personal knowledge.&nbsp; Other
enthusiasts enjoy no less satisfaction in talking of the interior
conflicts they have sustained; for all ungoverned feeling loves
to vent itself in speech, and the lover who talks of his
mistress, or the penitent who talks of his sins, is for the time
<a name="page58"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 58</span>being in
the same state of restless excitement.&nbsp; <i>Governed</i>
feeling, on the contrary, as far as my experience goes, is
silent.</p>
<p>In these Love Feasts those present have buns to eat, which are
mutually broken between each &ldquo;Brother and Sister,&rdquo;
and water to drink, which they hand from one to another.&nbsp;
These meetings commence about seven o&rsquo;clock, and last till
nine or ten.</p>
<p>Each society is divided into smaller companies called
&ldquo;classes&rdquo; according to their respective places of
abode.&nbsp; There are about twelve persons in every class, one
of whom is styled &ldquo;the Leader,&rdquo; whose business it is
to see each person in his class, at least once a week, to advise,
comfort, or exhort, as occasion may require, and to receive what
each is willing to give towards the support of the Gospel.</p>
<p>It is expected that every member should continue to evince his
desire of salvation by abstaining from &ldquo;the taking of the
name of the Lord in vain&rdquo;; &ldquo;the profaning of the
Lord&rsquo;s day, either by ordinary work thereon, or by buying
and selling&rdquo;; &ldquo;drunkenness, buying or selling
spirituous liquors, or drinking them, unless in cases of extreme
necessity; fighting, quarreling, brawling; going to law with a
brother; <a name="page59"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
59</span>returning evil for evil, or railing for railing; the
using many words in buying or selling. <a
name="citation59a"></a><a href="#footnote59a"
class="citation">[59a]</a>&nbsp; The buying or selling uncustomed
goods; the giving or taking things on usury, i.e. unlawful
interest; the putting on of gold or costly apparel; the taking
such diversions as cannot be used in the name of the Lord Jesus
Christ; the singing those songs or reading those books, that do
not tend to the knowledge or love of God;&mdash;softness and
needless self-indulgence, &amp;c. <a name="citation59b"></a><a
href="#footnote59b" class="citation">[59b]</a></p>
<p>Among the duties expected and required of the members are all
kinds of beneficence, diligence, frugality, <a
name="citation59c"></a><a href="#footnote59c"
class="citation">[59c]</a> self-denial, and attendance on all the
ordinances of God, among which is specifically mentioned
fasting.&nbsp; If any member habitually break any of these rules
he is admonished; <a name="page60"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
60</span>and if he do not then repent, expulsion follows.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Marrying with unbelievers,&rdquo; and bankruptcy, if the
party has not kept fair accounts, are also followed by
expulsion.</p>
<p>No one I think can doubt that much good was effected by the
first preaching of Wesley and his disciples, for at that time our
church was in a lethargic state, and the lower orders shamefully
neglected in spiritual matters in many parts of England.&nbsp;
Yet there are some things which excite one&rsquo;s regret in
their practices, and of these none displeases me more than the
familiar use of Scripture language, which when properly and
judiciously applied is striking and solemn; but to hear every
notion of enthusiastic ignorance, every rise and fall of the
animal spirits, expressed in the language of the Apostles and
Evangelists, and even of our <a name="page61"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 61</span>Lord himself; to witness their
familiarity with the Almighty, their full trust and confidence in
the reality of small miracles wrought at their
request;&mdash;must always be painful to a soberly religious
mind.&nbsp; In a book entitled &ldquo;The Bank of Faith,&rdquo;
the author asserts, that a dog brought him mutton to eat, that
fish died at night in a pond on purpose to be eaten by him in the
morning, and that money, clothes, &amp;c. in short every thing he
could desire he attained by prayer. <a name="citation61"></a><a
href="#footnote61" class="citation">[61]</a></p>
<p>An old woman of Wesley&rsquo;s society, named Mary Hubbard,
would often wash her linen, hang it out to dry, and go away to
work in the fields or to Taunton Market four miles from her
house, and when blamed for thus leaving her linen unprotected,
she would reply that &ldquo;the Lord watched over her and all
that she had, and that he would prevent any person from stealing
her two old smocks, or if He permitted them to be stolen, He
would send her two new ones in their stead.&rdquo;&nbsp; I
seriously assure you, <a name="page62"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 62</span>says the author who relates this
tale, and who at one time went even greater lengths <a
name="citation62"></a><a href="#footnote62"
class="citation">[62]</a> than this old woman, &ldquo;that there
are many thousand Mary Hubbards among the Methodists.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It may be added, that their strict abstinence from the common
amusements of the world, even where innocent in themselves, has
its evils, <a name="page63"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
63</span>as I have already noticed when speaking of the Quakers;
for the mind cannot always be kept in a state of tension, and if
we refuse ourselves recreation altogether, there is danger that
we shall find the yoke of Christ a wearisome instead of an easy
one, and cast it off in disgust; nay, I am afraid that if we were
to inquire closely, we should find instances enough of this
result to demonstrate, what indeed wants but little proof, i.e.
that God knows better than we do &ldquo;whereof we are
made,&rdquo; and that it is not wisdom to bind a heavy burthen on
our shoulders when Christ himself has declared that his is
light.&nbsp; Still, though tinged with a degree of enthusiasm
which we may regret, the doctrine of the Wesleyan Methodists
retains the fundamental parts of Christianity, and after reading
the following extracts from Wesley&rsquo;s Sermons, I think you
will hardly forbear asking, Why is this a separate sect?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Justifying Faith implies not only a Divine
&epsilon;&lambda;&epsilon;&gamma;&chi;&omicron;&sigmaf;, evidence
or conviction, that &lsquo;God was in Christ reconciling the
world to himself,&rsquo; but a sure trust and confidence that
Christ died for <i>my</i> sins, that he loved <i>me</i>, and gave
himself for me; and the moment a penitent sinner believes <a
name="page64"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 64</span>this, God
pardons and absolves him.&rdquo; <a name="citation64a"></a><a
href="#footnote64a" class="citation">[64a]</a>&nbsp;
&ldquo;Christian perfection does not imply, as some men seem to
have imagined, an exemption either from ignorance, or mistake, or
infirmities, or temptations; indeed it is only another term for
holiness: thus every one that is holy, is in the Scripture sense
&lsquo;perfect.&rsquo;&nbsp; We may yet observe that neither in
this respect is there absolute perfection on earth.&rdquo; <a
name="citation64b"></a><a href="#footnote64b"
class="citation">[64b]</a>&nbsp; &ldquo;If the Scriptures are
true, those who are holy or religious in the judgment of God
himself, those who are endued with the faith that purifies the
heart, that produces a good conscience; those who live by faith
in the Son of God; those who are sanctified <a
name="page65"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 65</span>by the blood
of the Covenant may nevertheless so fall from God as to perish
everlastingly, therefore let him who thinketh he standeth take
heed lest he fall.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;In strictness neither our
faith nor our works justify us, i.e. <i>deserve</i> the remission
of our sins, but God himself justifies us of his own mercy
through the merits of his Son only.&rdquo; <a

V.<br />
<span class="GutSmall">GENERAL BAPTISTS, MORAVIANS,
SWEDENBORGIANS, PLYMOUTH BRETHREN.</span></h2>
<p>Among the sects which arose about the period of the
Reformation of the church in the sixteenth century, we find the
Anabaptists <a name="citation66"></a><a href="#footnote66"
class="citation">[66]</a> playing rather a conspicuous part, by
exciting political tumults in Saxony and the adjacent
countries.&nbsp; For this, Munzer, their leader, after the defeat
of his forces, was put to death, and the sect generally was
proscribed, and the profession of its doctrines punished
capitally.&nbsp; What those doctrines were is not easy, nor is it
essential now, to state, since the modern sect, which we now term
Baptists, retain only so much of them as relates to baptism by
immersion, <a name="page67"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
67</span>and of adults only, and the rejection of episcopal
church government.</p>
<p>The more modern sect is subdivided into General and Particular
Baptists.&nbsp; The General or Arminian Baptists admit
&ldquo;much latitude in their system of religious doctrine, which
consists in such general principles, that their communion is
accessible to Christians of almost all denominations, and
accordingly they tolerate in fact, and receive among them persons
of every sect, who profess themselves Christians, and receive the
Holy Scriptures as the source of truth, and the rule of
faith.&rdquo; <a name="citation67"></a><a href="#footnote67"
class="citation">[67]</a>&nbsp; They agree with the <span
class="smcap">Particular Baptists</span> in this, that they admit
to baptism adults only, and administer that sacrament either by
dipping or total immersion; but they differ from them in another
respect, for they repeat the administration of baptism to those
who had received it, either in a state of infancy, or by
aspersion instead of dipping: for if the common accounts may be
believed, the Particular Baptists do not carry matters so
far.</p>
<p>The General Baptists consider their sect as the only true
church; in baptism they dip only once and not three times as was
the practice in <a name="page68"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
68</span>the primitive church: and they consider it a matter of
indifference whether that sacrament be administered in the name
of Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, or in that of Christ alone: <a
name="citation68a"></a><a href="#footnote68a"
class="citation">[68a]</a> they adopt the doctrine of Menno with
regard to the Millennium; many of them also embrace his
particular opinion concerning the origin of Christ&rsquo;s body.
<a name="citation68b"></a><a href="#footnote68b"
class="citation">[68b]</a>&nbsp; They look upon the precept of
the Apostles prohibiting the use of blood and of things
strangled, as a law that was designed to be in force in all ages
and periods of the church: they believe that the soul, from the
moment that the body dies until its resurrection at the last day,
remains in a state of perfect insensibility: they use the
ceremony of extreme unction, and finally, to omit matters of a
more trifling nature, several of them observe the Jewish as well
as the Christian Sabbath. <a name="citation68c"></a><a
href="#footnote68c" class="citation">[68c]</a>&nbsp; In some of
their churches they have three distinct orders separately
ordained, i.e. messengers, elders, and deacons; and their general
assembly (where a minister preaches, and the churches <a
name="page69"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 69</span>are taken
into consideration), is held annually in London on the Tuesday in
Whitsun week, and they afterwards dine together.&nbsp; They have
met thus for upwards of a century.</p>
<p>The propriety of the exclusive application of the term
&ldquo;Baptists&rdquo; to those who baptize adults by immersion,
has been questioned; and for this reason they are by many styled
Antip&aelig;dobaptists, <a name="citation69"></a><a
href="#footnote69" class="citation">[69]</a> namely, opposers of
infant baptism; but the term Anabaptist should not be applied to
them, it being a term of reproach.</p>
<p>The old General Baptists have been on the decline for many
years; their churches are principally in Kent and Sussex.&nbsp;
The English and most foreign Baptists consider a personal
profession of faith, and immersion in water, essential to
baptism: this profession is generally made before the church at a
church meeting.&nbsp; Some have a creed, and expect the candidate
for baptism to assent to it, and give a circumstantial account of
his conversion: others only require him to profess himself a
Christian.&nbsp; The former generally consider baptism as an
ordinance which initiates persons into a particular church, <a
name="page70"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 70</span>and they say,
that without breach of Christian liberty, they have a right to
expect an agreement in articles of faith in their own
societies.&nbsp; The latter think that baptism initiates into the
Christian religion generally, and therefore think that they have
no right to require an assent to their creed from such as do not
join their churches.&nbsp; They quote the baptism of the Eunuch
in Acts viii. in proof.</p>
<p>The first mention of the Baptists in English History is as the
subject of persecution in the reign of Henry VIII.&nbsp; During
that of Edward VI. a commission was issued to bishops and other
persons &ldquo;to try all Anabaptists, heretics, and despisers of
the common prayer,&rdquo; and they were empowered, in the event
of their contumacy, to commit them to the flames.&nbsp; The same
inhuman policy was persisted in under Elizabeth.&nbsp; The last
Baptist martyr burned in England was Edward Wightman; he was
condemned by the bishop of Lichfield and Coventry, <a
name="citation70a"></a><a href="#footnote70a"
class="citation">[70a]</a> and burned at Lichfield April 11,
1612. <a name="citation70b"></a><a href="#footnote70b"

<p>The celebrated Whiston became a Baptist <a

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>The <span class="smcap">Moravians</span> are supposed to have
derived their origin from Nicholas Lewis, Count Zinzendorf, a
German nobleman, who died in 1760.&nbsp; The society however
assert that they are descended from the old Moravian and Bohemian
Brethren, who existed as a distinct sect sixty years prior to the
Reformation.&nbsp; No sooner had these Moravian Brethren heard of
Luther&rsquo;s bold testimony to the truth, and of the success
which attended his labours, than they sent in the year 1522 two
deputies to assure him of &ldquo;the deep interest which they
took in his work;&rdquo; giving him, at the same time, an account
of their own doctrine and constitution.&nbsp; They were most
kindly received; and both Luther, and his colleague Bucer,
recognised the Moravians as holding the same faith; and bore
honourable testimony to the purity of their doctrine, and the
excellence of their discipline.&nbsp; The chief doctrine of the
Moravian society is, that &ldquo;by the sacrifice for sin made by
Jesus Christ, and by that alone, grace and deliverance from sin
are to be obtained for all mankind:&rdquo; and they stedfastly
maintain the following points:</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; The divinity of Christ.</p>
<p><a name="page72"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
72</span>2.&nbsp; The atonement and satisfaction made for us by
Jesus Christ; and that by his merits alone we receive freely the
forgiveness of sin, and sanctification in soul and body.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp; The doctrine of the Holy Spirit, and the operations
of his grace.&nbsp; That it is he who worketh in us conviction of
sin, faith in Christ, and pureness of heart.</p>
<p>4.&nbsp; That faith must evidence itself by willing obedience
to the commandments of God from love and gratitude.</p>
<p>The internal constitution of the ancient church of the
Moravians, which is still substantially adhered to, was
originally adopted in 1457, and more definitely settled in 1616
by the Synod of Zerawitz.&nbsp; Its principal peculiarities
are,</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; Every church is divided into three classes, i.e. 1.
<i>Beginners</i> or <i>Catechumens</i>.&nbsp; 2.&nbsp; <i>The
more advanced</i> or <i>communicants</i>, who are considered as
members of the church.&nbsp; 3. <i>The perfect</i>, consisting of
such as have persevered for some time in a course of true
piety.&nbsp; From this last class are chosen in every church
<i>the Elders</i>, from three to eight in number.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; Every congregation is directed by a board of elders,
whose province it is to have a watchful eye over its members with
respect to the <a name="page73"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
73</span>doctrine and deportment.&nbsp; Once in three months
these elders are bound to visit the houses of the brethren, in
order to observe their conduct, and to ascertain whether every
one is labouring diligently in his calling, &amp;c. of which they
make a report to the pastor.&nbsp; They also are required to
visit the sick, and assist the poorer brethren with money,
contributed by the members of the church, and deposited in an
alms box.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp; The ministration of the Word and Sacrament is
performed either by members who have received ordination from the
bishops of the church of the brethren, or by those who have
received that of the Calvinist or Lutheran church.&nbsp; The
deacons, according to the ancient constitution of the church, are
the chief assistants of the pastors, and are considered as
candidates for the ministry.&nbsp; The bishops, who are nominated
by the ministers, appoint the pastors to their stations, and have
the power of removing them when they think fit, and of ordaining
the deacons as well as the ministers.&nbsp; Every bishop is
appointed to superintend a certain number of churches, and has
two or three co-bishops, who, if necessary, supply their
place.&nbsp; The ancient church appointed some of its members to
the business of watching over the civil <a
name="page74"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 74</span>affairs of
the congregation, under the name of <i>Seniores Civiles</i>, who
were ordained with imposition of hands.&nbsp; This office is
still continued.&nbsp; The synods, which are held every three or
four years, are composed of the bishops and their co-bishops the
Seniores Civiles, and of &ldquo;such servants of the church and
of the congregation as are called to the synod by the former
elders&rsquo; conference, appointed by the previous synod, or
commissioned to attend it as deputies from particular
congregations.&rdquo;&nbsp; Several female elders also are
usually present at the synods, but they have no vote.&nbsp; All
the transactions of the synod are committed to writing, and
communicated to the several congregations.</p>
<p>A liturgy, peculiar to the Brethren, is regularly used as a
part of the morning service on the Sabbath; on other occasions
the minister offers extempore prayer.&nbsp; The singing of hymns
is considered as an essential part of worship, and many of their
services consist entirely of singing.&nbsp; At the baptism of
children, both the witnesses and the minister bless the infant,
with laying on of hands immediately after the rite.&nbsp; The
Lord&rsquo;s Supper is celebrated every month: love feasts are
frequently held, i.e. the members eat and drink together in
fellowship: cakes and <a name="page75"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 75</span>tea are distributed during the
singing of some verses by the congregation.&nbsp; The washing of
feet is practised at present only at certain seasons by the whole
congregation, and on some other occasions in the choirs.&nbsp;
Dying persons are blessed for their departure by the elders,
during prayer and singing a verse with imposition of hands.&nbsp;
At funerals, the pastor accompanies the corpse to the burial
place with the singing of hymns; and an address is delivered at
the grave.&nbsp; Marriages are, by general agreement, never
contracted without the advice and concurrence of the elders. <a
name="citation75a"></a><a href="#footnote75a"
class="citation">[75a]</a>&nbsp; The casting of lots is used
among them to know, as they express it, &ldquo;The will of the
Lord.&rdquo; <a name="citation75b"></a><a href="#footnote75b"
class="citation">[75b]</a></p>
<p>With regard to discipline, &ldquo;the Church of the Brethren
have agreed upon certain rules and orders.&nbsp; These are laid
before every one, that <a name="page76"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 76</span>desires to become a member of the
church, for his consideration.&nbsp; Whoever after having
voluntarily agreed to them, does not act conformably, falls under
congregation discipline.&rdquo;&nbsp; This has various degrees,
and consists in admonitions, warnings, and reproofs, continued
until genuine repentance and a real conversion become evident in
the offender, when he is readmitted to the holy communion, or
reconciled to the congregation, after a deprecatory letter has
been read, expressing the offender&rsquo;s sorrow for his
transgression, and asking forgiveness.&nbsp; The Brethren assert
that the church government in the established Protestant churches
&ldquo;does not apply to the congregations of the Brethren,
because they never were intended to form a national
establishment: for their design is no other than to be a true and
living congregation of Jesus Christ, and to build up each other
as a spiritual house of God, to the end that the kingdom of Jesus
Christ may be furthered by them.&rdquo;&nbsp; Hence the doctrine
of Jesus and his Apostles, and the order and practice of the
Apostolic churches, are the models by which they wish to be
formed.&nbsp; It may be added, that they are generally the most
successful Missionaries, and that their society seems the most
nearly to realize <a name="page77"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
77</span>the practice of the early Christians, of any sect now
remaining.</p>
<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>The <span class="smcap">Swedenborgians</span> take their name
from Emmanuel Swedenborg, who was born at Stockholm in
1683.&nbsp; His father was Jasper Swedberg, bishop of West
Gothland.&nbsp; He received his education chiefly in the
University of Upsala; and in 1716 was appointed by Charles XII.
Assessor of the Royal College of Sciences; he was ennobled by
Queen Ulrica Eleonora, and received the name of Swedenborg.&nbsp;
He published scientific works on various subjects, but in 1747 he
resigned his office, in order, as he himself states, that he
might be more at liberty to attend to that new function which he
considered himself called to, and the rest of his life was spent
in composing and publishing the voluminous works which contain
his peculiar doctrines.&nbsp; He died in 1772.&nbsp; He was a man
of blameless life and amiable deportment, and was distinguished
for his attainments in mathematics and mechanics.</p>
<p>His writings are so very obscure, that it is difficult to
state what are the opinions contained in them; he taught,
however, that by the New Jerusalem which came down from heaven,
was <a name="page78"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
78</span>intended a new church as to doctrine, and that he was
the person to whom this doctrine was revealed, and who was
appointed to make it known to the world.&nbsp; Swedenborg made no
attempt to found a sect; but after his death, his followers, in
1788, formed themselves into a society under the denomination of
&ldquo;The New Jerusalem Church.&rdquo;&nbsp; They have several
places of meeting, both in London and Manchester, and send
delegates to a &ldquo;General Conference,&rdquo; under whose
direction a liturgy has been prepared, from which I shall make a
few extracts to shew the peculiar doctrines of this sect.</p>
<p>The following are some of the questions asked of the candidate
for ordination, which is performed by imposition of hands, of
course of a minister of their own communion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Min.</i>&nbsp; Dost thou believe that Jehovah God is
One both in Essence and in Person; in whom, nevertheless, is the
Divine Trinity of Father, Son, and Holy Spirit; and that these
are, his Essential Divinity, his Divine Humanity, and his Divine
Proceeding, which are the three Essentials of One God, answering
to the soul, the body, and the operative energy, in man, and that
the Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ is that God?</p>
<p>Dost thou believe that by his temptations, <a
name="page79"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 79</span>the last of
which was the passion of the cross, the Lord united, in his
Humanity, Divine Truth to Divine Good, or Divine Wisdom to Divine
Love, and so returned into his Divinity in which he was from
eternity, together with, and in, his Glorified Humanity?</p>
<p>Dost thou believe that the sacred Scripture, or Word of God,
is Divine Truth itself, and that it contains a spiritual and
celestial sense, heretofore unknown, whence it is divinely
inspired and holy in every syllable; as well as a literal sense,
which is the basis and support of its spiritual and celestial
sense?</p>
<p>Dost thou believe that the books which have the internal sense
and are truly the Word of God are,&mdash;the five books of Moses,
Joshua, Judges, the two books of Samuel, the two books of Kings,
the Psalms of David, the prophets, including the Lamentations of
Jeremiah, the four Gospels, and the Revelation?&rdquo; <a
name="citation79"></a><a href="#footnote79"
class="citation">[79]</a></p>
<p>It is further stated in their eleventh article of faith,
&ldquo;That immediately after death, which is only a putting off
of the material body, never to be resumed, man rises again in a
spiritual or <a name="page80"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
80</span>substantial body, in which he continues to live to
eternity.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On these doctrines it may be observed that the forms of
worship founded on them are not such as Christ and his apostles
ordered.&nbsp; The doxology is, &ldquo;To Jesus Christ be glory
and dominion for ever and ever;&rdquo; the blessing, &ldquo;The
grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all.&rdquo;&nbsp; The
prayers are addressed to the &ldquo;blessed Lord
Jesus.&rdquo;&nbsp; Whereas Christ, when he gave us a form of
prayer, bade us address &ldquo;our Father in heaven;&rdquo; and
bade us ask of the Father in his name; and the form of the
apostolic doxology is, &ldquo;To God only wise be glory through
Jesus Christ for ever&rdquo;; <a name="citation80a"></a><a
href="#footnote80a" class="citation">[80a]</a> and the blessing,
&ldquo;Grace be unto you and peace from God our Father, and from
the Lord Jesus Christ.&rdquo; <a name="citation80b"></a><a
href="#footnote80b" class="citation">[80b]</a>&nbsp; As at this
time Christ had ascended from the earth, had the human nature
been entirely merged in the Divine, as this sect asserts, Paul
the Apostle would not have made this distinction, which implies
that the Lord Jesus still existed somewhere in his human form as
the everlasting visible temple of the Invisible father of all
things, for &ldquo;no man hath seen God at <a
name="page81"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 81</span>any
time,&rdquo; says the beloved Apostle, <a
name="citation81a"></a><a href="#footnote81a"
class="citation">[81a]</a> and this is confirmed by Christ
himself. <a name="citation81b"></a><a href="#footnote81b"
class="citation">[81b]</a>&nbsp; If the man then be lost in the
Deity, it follows that the Lord Jesus exists no more for
us.&nbsp; I am aware that this consequence is denied by the sect,
but it is a self evident proposition: for their creed runs thus,
&ldquo;I believe in one God in whom is a Divine Trinity, &amp;c.,
and that this God is the Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ who is
Jehovah in a glorified human form.&rdquo;&nbsp; Now a human form
must have some properties of matter; it must be visible, and
circumscribed, or it is not form; and what is circumscribed and
visible cannot be God, who, of necessity, is uncircumscribed, and
therefore invisible.&nbsp; The infinite Eternal Omnipotent Deity
<i>must</i> be where that glorified body is not; therefore, the
Great Father of all things must always be the object of worship,
through Jesus Christ, who is the <i>visible</i> image of his
glory.&nbsp; The <i>form</i> of baptism is retained by this sect,
though they assert that the rite was &ldquo;constantly
administered by the Apostles in the name of Christ alone&rdquo;;
an assertion contradicted by the whole testimony of antiquity
from the earliest times; adding, &ldquo;nevertheless it is <a
name="page82"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 82</span>well to use
the express words of the Lord, when it is known and acknowledged
in the church that the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit are
not three separate persons but three Divine Essentials,
constituting the single Divine Person of our Lord Jesus
Christ.&rdquo; <a name="citation82"></a><a href="#footnote82"
class="citation">[82]</a>&nbsp; With regard to the
&ldquo;internal sense&rdquo; of Scripture it is sufficient to
observe that if &ldquo;every syllable&rdquo; were to be
considered as inspired and holy, the long list of various
readings would grievously shake our faith, though these are quite
immaterial as to the general meaning.</p>
<p>There are serious objections to the distinctive tenets of this
sect, yet, in justice to them, it must be allowed that the
unguarded language of some preachers does so split up the Deity
into separate individuals as to make the doctrine so taught a
complete tritheism, and that a serious mind returning to the
express declaration of the Scripture, that God is One, may be so
far shocked by such unmeasured expressions, as to run into the
extreme which I have condemned.&nbsp; Unitarianism on the one
hand, and the doctrine of Swedenborg on the other, have equally
sprung from a want of proper caution when speaking of <a
name="page83"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 83</span>the different
manifestations of the Deity, and an unmeasured itch for the
definition of things too far beyond the reach of our finite
faculties to admit of any precision of terms.&nbsp; <i>Words</i>
were formed for the things pertaining to earth; how then can they
ever exactly express the nature of the Deity?</p>
<p>Notwithstanding the faith professed by this sect, their
teaching, nevertheless, returns to the doctrine of the
Gospel.&nbsp; In a tract &ldquo;on the true meaning of the
intercession of Jesus Christ,&rdquo; published at Manchester by
their own religious tract society, we have the following passage:
&ldquo;The Humanity named Jesus is the medium whereby man may
come to God, because the Father, <i>heretofore invisible</i>, is
manifested and made <i>visible</i> and <i>approachable</i> in
him.&nbsp; This is meant by <i>our coming unto God by
him</i>;&rdquo; and elsewhere, as we cannot obtain this
&ldquo;light of life&rdquo; without following the Lord, and doing
his will, as he did the will of the Father, agreeably to his own
saying, &ldquo;If ye keep my commandments, even as I have kept my
Father&rsquo;s commandments, and abide in his love;&rdquo; so
neither can we obtain that divine food by which our spiritual
life is to be sustained, unless we labour for it, as the Lord
himself instructed us when he <a name="page84"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 84</span>said &ldquo;Labour for the meat which
endureth unto everlasting life&rdquo;; and is it not of the
greatest importance clearly to understand what this labour
implies?&nbsp; Let the reader be assured that he must labour in
that spiritual vineyard which the Lord desires to plant in his
soul, in order that it may bear abundant fruits of righteousness
to the glory of his heavenly father.&rdquo; <a
name="citation84"></a><a href="#footnote84"
class="citation">[84]</a>&nbsp; Thus we see again that the
fundamental doctrines of Christianity <i>will</i> find their way,
however men may speculatively disclaim them.&nbsp; Why then do we
differ outwardly, when at heart we agree?</p>
<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>The <span class="smcap">Plymouth Brethren</span>, so called
probably from the place where this society first arose, do not
allow themselves to be a sect, though in their practices they
differ considerably from those of the Established Church.&nbsp;
They meet together on the morning of the first day of the week to
celebrate the Lord&rsquo;s Supper, when any &ldquo;Brother&rdquo;
is at liberty to speak for mutual edification.&nbsp; In the
afternoon and evening, when they have preachers, the services are
similar to those in the Congregational Churches (Independents):
<a name="page85"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 85</span>the desk,
however, for they condemn pulpits, is not occupied by one man,
but used as a convenient place for speaking, being alternately
occupied by the &ldquo;Brother,&rdquo; who reads the hymn, the
one who prays, and the one who teaches or preaches the
Word.&nbsp; There are also &ldquo;Meetings for Prayer,&rdquo; and
what are technically called &ldquo;reading meetings;&rdquo; when
a chapter is read, and those &ldquo;Brethren&rdquo; who have made
it matter of reflection, speak upon it clause by clause for their
mutual instruction.</p>
<p>Before a person is acknowledged a &ldquo;Brother,&rdquo; his
name is announced at one of the times of &ldquo;meeting together
to break bread,&rdquo; as it is termed, and if nothing occurs in
the interval, he takes his seat with them the next Sunday.<a
name="citation85"></a><a href="#footnote85"
class="citation">[85]</a>&nbsp; Any one is admitted to their
communion whom they believe to be &ldquo;a child of God;&rdquo;
but they do not receive or acknowledge him as a brother,
&ldquo;while in actual connection with any of the various forms
of worldliness,&rdquo; i.e. the other churches of Christ.&nbsp;
Their preachers move about from place to place, forming different
congregations, which they again leave for other places where
their services are required.&nbsp; None of their <a
name="page86"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 86</span>ministers
receive any <i>stipulated</i> charity.&nbsp; The
&ldquo;Brethren&rdquo; disapprove of any association of
Christians for any purpose whatever, whether civil or religious,
and therefore discountenance all Sunday School, Bible,
Missionary, or even purely Benevolent, Societies.&nbsp; They do
not disapprove of sending either Bibles or Missionaries to the
heathen; but they say that if they go at all, &ldquo;God and not
the church must send them.&rdquo;&nbsp; They do not think that
the Gospel is to convert the world, but that it is to be
&ldquo;preached as a witness to&rdquo; or rather against
&ldquo;all nations.&rdquo;&nbsp; The world, they say, &ldquo;is
reserved for judgment, and therefore it is wholly contrary to the
character of a Christian to have any thing to do with it or its
government.&rdquo;&nbsp; When a child of God is born again,
&ldquo;he lays,&rdquo; say they, &ldquo;all his worldly relations
down at the feet of Christ, and he is at liberty to take up none
but those which he can take up in the Lord.&rdquo;&nbsp; They
neither pray for pardon of sin, nor for the presence and
influence of the Spirit, and carefully exclude such petitions
from their hymns.&nbsp; Many of them think it inconsistent with
the Christian character to amass wealth, or to possess furniture
or clothing more than is <i>necessary</i> for health and <a
name="page87"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 87</span>cleanliness;
and very great sacrifices have been made by the more wealthy of
them.</p>
<p>These are most of them unimportant peculiarities; but the
great feature of this sect, for so notwithstanding their protest,
I must call these &ldquo;Brethren,&rdquo; is a degree of self
approbation and uncharity for others, which, to say the least, is
not what Christ taught.&nbsp; &ldquo;No sect,&rdquo; says Rust,
<a name="citation87a"></a><a href="#footnote87a"
class="citation">[87a]</a> &ldquo;is more Sectarian, and none
more separate from Christians of all denominations than
&ldquo;The Plymouth Brethren.&rdquo;&nbsp; The Church of Rome
they consider &ldquo;bad.&rdquo;&nbsp; The Church of England
&ldquo;bad.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;A popish priest and a parish
priest, both bad;&rdquo; &ldquo;but infinitely worse,&rdquo; says
one of the Brethren (a Captain Hall), &ldquo;is a people&rsquo;s
preacher.&rdquo;&nbsp; They occasionally indulge in what they
term &ldquo;biting jests and sarcastic raillery,&rdquo; of the
ministers of our church, and of those who differ from them, which
evince but little of the meek and peaceable spirit of the Gospel;
<a name="citation87b"></a><a href="#footnote87b"
class="citation">[87b]</a> for, <a name="page88"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 88</span>as Lord Bacon has well observed,
&ldquo;to intermix Scripture with scurrility in one
sentence;&mdash;the majesty of religion and the contempt and
deformity of things ridiculous,&mdash;is a thing far from the
reverence of a devout Christian, and hardly becoming the honest
regard of a sober man.&rdquo;&nbsp; If I have appeared to speak
harshly of this <a name="page89"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
89</span>sect, it is because they seem to me to have abandoned so
much of the spirit of the Gospel.&nbsp; &ldquo;If the tenets of
the Plymouth Brethren be consistent with themselves,&rdquo;
observes Mr. Rust, &ldquo;they necessarily withdraw them from all
society, and every existing form of Christianity, shutting them
out from all co-operation with the holy and benevolent, for the
relief and blessing of their poor or sinful fellow creatures,
making it sinful to fulfil the duties of a subject, a citizen,
&amp;c.&rdquo;&nbsp; But I hope and believe that these tenets
must be and are counteracted by the instinctive love of our kind,
which for the benefit of the world God has implanted in
man.&nbsp; The human race is so essentially social that they who
endeavour to dissociate mankind, stand in much the same situation
as he would do who should hope to dam up the ocean.&nbsp; It is
in fact to these silent tendencies of human nature, whose force
we never know till we attempt to check them, that we owe much of
the innocuousness of false or overstrained opinions: the reason
is deluded, but the feelings which the Creator has made a part of
our very being, generally correct the false argument; and the
man, if not previously corrupted by vice, acts right though he
argues wrong.</p>

<h2><a name="page90"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 90</span>LETTER
VI.<br />
<span class="GutSmall">CALVINISM.</span></h2>
<p>I have already noticed that the sects into which the reformed
churches are split, may be classified generally under two great
divisions, the one adopting mainly the milder views of
Melancthon, whose advice was much used in the reform of the
Anglican church; the other following those of Calvin, which were
chiefly carried out, at Geneva, the birthplace of that reformer,
and among the Huguenots of France.&nbsp; It may be well,
therefore, before we proceed to notice the particular sects which
profess to combine in a greater or less degree the doctrines
usually termed Calvinistic, to examine what the opinions are
which pass under that name. <a name="citation90"></a><a
href="#footnote90" class="citation">[90]</a></p>
<p><a name="page91"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 91</span>It was
at the Synod of Dort, which was assembled in the year 1618, that
these opinions received a decided form; for James Arminius,
professor of divinity in the University of Leyden, having
rejected some part of the Genevan doctrine respecting
predestination and grace, this synod was called in order to
settle the disputed points.&nbsp; After much debate the opinions
of Arminius were condemned, and the doctrine of Calvin was summed
up in five points, which gave name to what has been called the
Quinqueticular controversy between the Calvinistic and
Anti-calvinistic divines of Holland.&nbsp; They related to,</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; Predestination or Election.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; The extent of redemption.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp; Moral depravity and impotency. <a
name="citation91"></a><a href="#footnote91"
class="citation">[91]</a></p>
<p>4.&nbsp; Effectual calling.</p>
<p>5.&nbsp; Final perseverance of the sanctified.</p>
<p>Calvinists are understood to maintain that predestination is
absolute; redemption limited; <a name="page92"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 92</span>moral impotency total; grace
inevitable; and the salvation of the believer, certain.&nbsp; But
among Calvinistic as among Arminian divines, there are many
shades of difference indicated by the terms <i>high</i>
Calvinist, and <i>moderate</i> Calvinist, <i>sub</i> lapsarian
and <i>supra</i> lapsarian, <i>scholastic</i> Calvinism and
<i>popular</i> Calvinism; which latter has been described as
&ldquo;the Augustinian theology strained off from its
mathematics.&rdquo;&nbsp; These all differ so materially that
Bishop Horsley found it necessary to admonish his clergy
&ldquo;to beware how they aimed their shaft at Calvinism before
they knew what it is, and what it is not;&rdquo; a great part of
what ignorantly goes under that name, being &ldquo;closely
interwoven with the very rudiments of Christianity.&rdquo;&nbsp;
I believe, however, that though differences may subsist among
Calvinists themselves, as to the explication of their doctrines,
they generally allow,</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; That God has chosen a certain number in Christ, to
everlasting glory before the foundation of the world, according
to his immutable purpose, and of his free grace and love; without
the least foresight of faith, good works, or any conditions
performed by the creature; and that the rest of mankind he was
pleased to pass by, <a name="page93"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
93</span>and ordain them to dishonour and wrath for their sins to
the praise of his vindictive justice.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; That Christ by his death and sufferings made an
atonement only for the sins of the elect. <a
name="citation93a"></a><a href="#footnote93a"
class="citation">[93a]</a></p>
<p>3.&nbsp; That mankind are <i>totally</i> depraved in
consequence of the fall.</p>
<p>4.&nbsp; That all whom God has predestined to life, he is
pleased in his appointed time effectually to call by his Word and
Spirit out of that state of sin and death in which they are by
nature, to grace and salvation by Jesus Christ.</p>
<p>5.&nbsp; That those whom God has effectually called and
sanctified by his Spirit, shall never finally fall from a state
of grace.</p>
<p>The prominent feature then, of the Calvinistic system, <a
name="citation93b"></a><a href="#footnote93b"
class="citation">[93b]</a> is the election of some, and <a
name="page94"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 94</span>reprobation
of others from all eternity; but to <a name="page95"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 95</span>this we may answer, that if all
mankind are really appointed to sin and punishment, holiness and
salvation irrespectively to any act of their own, then they will
be judged in exact opposition to our Saviour&rsquo;s declaration,
that he will reward every man <i>according to his works</i>: <a
name="citation95a"></a><a href="#footnote95a"
class="citation">[95a]</a> and again, that it is &ldquo;not the
will of &lsquo;our&rsquo; Father which is in heaven that one of
those little ones,&rdquo; i.e. children, &ldquo;should
perish.&rdquo; <a name="citation95b"></a><a href="#footnote95b"
class="citation">[95b]</a>&nbsp; These declarations would, I
think, sufficiently prove that St. Paul&rsquo;s expressions on
the subject relate to national, and not individual election, even
had the Apostle himself left his meaning unexplained: for the
servant is not greater than his master, and it is not possible
that an inspired Apostle should preach a doctrine different from
that of Him who commissioned him; but if I mistake not, he has
himself taken especial care that his meaning on this important
subject should <i>not</i> be misunderstood.&nbsp; For first, it
is a notorious fact, though often overlooked in argument, that
the very passage, &ldquo;I will have mercy on whom I will have
mercy, and I will have compassion on whom I will have
compassion,&rdquo; which is the main support claimed for the
doctrine of <a name="page96"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
96</span>absolute decrees, is quoted from Exodus, and forms the
assurance given by God himself to Moses, that He had separated
<i>the Hebrew nation</i> from all the people on the face of the
earth. <a name="citation96a"></a><a href="#footnote96a"
class="citation">[96a]</a>&nbsp; Again St. Paul has asserted that
God will render to <i>every</i> man <i>according to his
deeds</i>, for there is <i>no respect of persons</i> with God. <a
name="citation96b"></a><a href="#footnote96b"
class="citation">[96b]</a>&nbsp; God will have <i>all men</i> to
be saved, &amp;c. &amp;c.</p>
<p>God forbid that we should consider that a man may not be a
sincere Christian, who believes himself irrevocably called,
&ldquo;elect,&rdquo; and inevitably secure of his salvation; or
declare that a strict Calvinist cannot be attached to our church:
but St. Paul teaches that &ldquo;Christ died for all;&rdquo; that
grace instead of being irresistible may be received in vain; that
those who have been once justified instead of being <i>sure</i>
of &ldquo;final perseverance&rdquo; and salvation, <i>may</i>
&ldquo;sin wilfully after they have received the knowledge of the
truth,&rdquo; and &ldquo;draw back to perdition,&rdquo; so that
it behoves every one &ldquo;who thinketh he standeth to take heed
lest he fall.&rdquo; <a name="citation96c"></a><a
href="#footnote96c" class="citation">[96c]</a></p>
<p><a name="page97"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 97</span>In
regard to &ldquo;irresistible&rdquo; (special)
&ldquo;grace,&rdquo; Scripture assures us that grace sufficient
for salvation is denied to none; for St. Paul in every passage of
the Epistles, which relates to grace, declares that the Spirit
works in the souls of <i>all</i>, enabling them, if they do not
obstinately resist it, &ldquo;to work out their
salvation.&rdquo;&nbsp; The following passage is taken from the
work of a teacher of the doctrine of Special Grace.&nbsp;
&ldquo;The reign of sin consists not in the multitude, greatness
or prevalency of sins, for all these are consistent with a state
of grace, and may be in a child of God, in whom sin doth not and
cannot reign; but in the in-being of sin without grace, whether
it act more or less violently, yea, whether it acts at all or no:
yet if the habit of sin possess the soul without any principle of
grace implanted, which is contrary to it, that man may be said to
be still under the dominion of sin.&nbsp; This mortification then
of sin, as to its reigning power, is completed in the first act
of <a name="page98"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
98</span>conversion and regeneration.&rdquo; <a
name="citation98a"></a><a href="#footnote98a"
class="citation">[98a]</a>&nbsp; But this language is by no means
that of St. Paul: for the writer makes grace the test of
holiness; whereas the apostle, following therein the doctrine of
his master,&mdash;&ldquo;by their fruits ye shall know
them,&rdquo;&mdash;makes holiness the test of grace.&nbsp; Indeed
the obscurity and perplexing nature of the doctrine above quoted,
stands in no favourable contrast with the simple and clear
declaration of the Saviour, that we &ldquo;do not gather grapes
of thorns, nor figs of thistles,&rdquo;&mdash;and that therefore
the heart must be known by the words and actions: and the no less
decided and simple exposition of the doctrine of Christ, by the
beloved disciple, &ldquo;Little children, let no man deceive you:
he that doeth righteousness is righteous . . . he that committeth
sin is of the devil.&nbsp; Whosoever is born of God <i>doth not
commit sin</i> . . . whosoever doeth not righteousness is not of
God.&rdquo; <a name="citation98b"></a><a href="#footnote98b"
class="citation">[98b]</a></p>
<p>The doctrine of the <i>total</i> depravity of human nature, it
appears to me, cannot be proved from <a name="page99"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 99</span>Scripture any more than the two
former.&nbsp; St. John, whilst asserting that no man is wholly
without sin, exhorts to efforts, and supposes a possible state of
Christian perfection in his converts, wholly incompatible with a
state of entire corruption: and St. Paul, though he clearly
states that sin has brought all men under condemnation, and that
the unspirituality of the flesh can only be successfully opposed
by the influence of the Holy Spirit, does not declare the
consequences of the Fall in terms such as we find in the
Calvinistic writers&mdash;as &ldquo;Man, instead of the image of
God, was now become the image of the Devil; instead of the
citizen of heaven, he was become the bond-slave of hell, having
in himself no one part of his former purity, but being altogether
spotted and defiled&mdash;now he seemed to be nothing else but a
lump of sin.&rdquo;&nbsp; And again: &ldquo;Man is of his own
nature fleshly and corrupt, &amp;c. without any spark of goodness
in him; only given to evil thoughts and evil deeds.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Even human nature, if closely examined, does not bear testimony
to this as truth: for either the grace of God is accorded in such
large measure to man from his birth, that none can be considered
as wholly bad; or the utter corruption preached by Calvin does <a
name="page100"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 100</span>not
exist.&nbsp; All experience may be appealed to on this point,
even that of the persons who use the above language; for if they
search their own hearts in sincerity, they will become conscious
of amiable affections, and admiration of what is good and right:
neither, probably, are they guilty of any such gross and habitual
sins, as must mark a nature so wholly depraved.&nbsp; The
Calvinist therefore can only use these strong phrases with
certain grains of allowance: and he would be wiser if he were to
avoid offending his&mdash;if he prefer so to call
him&mdash;weaker brother, by technical terms which he himself
cannot use in their <i>full force</i> before the Searcher of
hearts.</p>

101</span>LETTER VII.<br />
<span class="GutSmall">PRESBYTERIANS.&nbsp;
INDEPENDENTS.</span></h2>
<p>When the preaching of Luther and his coadjutors had
effectually called men&rsquo;s attention to the affairs of the
church, it was natural that questions with regard to its
government no less than its doctrine, should be freely
mooted.&nbsp; The usurpations of Rome had a tendency to disgust
the Reformers with episcopal government, and accordingly we find
both Calvin and Luther establishing a more republican form; and
instead of giving the ecclesiastical power into the hands of one
man, they judged it proper to delegate it to the elders
(presbyters) of each church respectively; subject only to the
control of the majority of a general synod.&nbsp; Such was the
origin of what we now term Presbyterians as a sect: for in
<i>England</i> more moderate councils, and the circumstance that
the reformed tenets were embraced by many of the bishops, led to
retaining the Episcopal form of church government.&nbsp; In
<i>Scotland</i>, after a struggle, the Presbyterian <a
name="page102"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 102</span>form was
finally established, and the church or kirk of that part of Great
Britain is regulated upon that system.&nbsp; A secession has
lately taken place on the question of the right of presentation
to livings, but the <i>doctrine</i> taught in both is nearly
similar, i.e. that of the Calvinistic churches.</p>
<p>The General Synod of Ulster (originally a branch of the
established kirk of Scotland), is the principal body of
Presbyterians considered as dissenters from the establishment:
and there also, there is a Presbyterian Synod, or Church of
&ldquo;the Apostolic Seceders,&rdquo; formed by seceders from the
General Synod, which is thoroughly Calvinistic, and which
maintains the same discipline that is usually observed among the
seceding &ldquo;Scottish Presbyterians.&rdquo;&nbsp; In the reign
of Geo. I. Arianism <a name="citation102"></a><a
href="#footnote102" class="citation">[102]</a> was openly
embraced by some of the more speculative of the Presbyterian
ministers <a name="page103"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
103</span>in Ireland, and in consequence, a theological
controversy was carried on for twenty years (from 1705 to 1725),
which ended in the secession of eight Arian ministers, and the
formation of the Presbytery of Antrim.&nbsp; Some who were
secretly inclined to Arianism had not the courage to follow the
example of the eight seceders, and the leaven continued to spread
among the general body during the latter part of the eighteenth
century, till at length inquiries were instituted in the Synod,
which led to a fresh separation.&nbsp; Seventeen at length
seceded out of thirty-seven ministers, holding Arian or Socinian
tenets in the year 1830, and they subsequently formed themselves
into a distinct Synod, under the name of &ldquo;the Remonstrant
Synod of Ulster,&rdquo; and the Presbytery of Antrim has now
become incorporated with this Synod.&nbsp; These Arian
congregations are chiefly situated in the counties of Antrim and
Down, in the north and eastern part of the province.&nbsp; There
are ten or twelve congregations in the south of Ireland forming
the Synod of Munster, which were also, till within a few years,
Arian or Socinian.&nbsp; The total number of Remonstrant and
Socinian congregations is between thirty and forty.&nbsp;
<i>All</i> the Presbyterian bodies,&mdash;Orthodox and Arian,
share <a name="page104"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 104</span>in
the Government grants known under the name of &ldquo;Regium
Donum.&rdquo;&nbsp; This royal bounty was originally dispensed
among the Presbyterian clergy of Ulster in lieu of the tithes
which were taken from them at the Restoration, and bestowed upon
the Episcopal conformists.&nbsp; It was withdrawn towards the
close of the reign of Charles II.; but at the Revolution, letters
patent passed the great seal of Ireland, granting &pound;1200 per
annum to seven Presbyterian ministers, during pleasure, for the
use of the ministers of the north of Ireland, to be paid
quarterly out of any of the revenues of the kingdom.&nbsp; This
grant was renewed, under certain limitations, in the reign of
Queen Anne: and in the reign of Geo. I. &pound;800 per annum was
divided in equal shares between the ministers of the Ulster Synod
and those of the Southern Association.&nbsp; In 1784 an
additional grant was made to the Ulster Synod of &pound;1000 per
annum.&nbsp; In 1792 the grant was augmented to &pound;5000 to be
divided among the ministers of the Synod,&mdash;the Presbytery of
Antrim,&mdash;the Seceders,&mdash;the Southern
Association,&mdash;and the ministers of the French church,
Dublin.&nbsp; In 1803 some fresh regulations were made, by which
the distribution of the bounty was <a name="page105"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 105</span>taken immediately into the hands of
Government, and the Presbyterian clergy were thus rendered more
ostensibly what they had previously been only in effect, i.e.,
stipendiaries of the state.&nbsp; The congregations under the
care of the several Synods and Presbyteries are now arranged in
three classes according to the number of families and the stipend
of each minister; and the allowance to the ministers of the three
classes was fixed at &pound;50, &pound;75, and &pound;100 per
annum.&nbsp; The members of the congregation feel under no
obligation to contribute much, if anything, to their
pastor&rsquo;s support, who is therefore often compelled to have
recourse to farming, grazing, or some other secular employment,
for the support of his family.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In 1834 the ascendant party in the Synod succeeded in
carrying a resolution enforcing unqualified subscription to the
&ldquo;Confession of Faith,&rdquo; which had not previously been
enforced.&nbsp; The ostensible motive for this is a desire to
bring about a closer union with the Established Church of
Scotland.&nbsp; The Irish Synod being now so far connected with
the state as to form a species of ecclesiastical establishment, a
feeling has been generated in favour of the established <a
name="page106"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 106</span>church of
both countries: a strong protest, however has been made against
the decision, but without avail.&rdquo; <a
name="citation106"></a><a href="#footnote106"
class="citation">[106]</a></p>
<p>The increase of the Presbyterians in Ireland from whatever
cause has borne no due proportion to that of the general
population.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Presbyterianism received as a scheme of policy, though
admirably adapted to the exigencies of the times in which it
originated, partakes of the essential defectiveness of the
incipient reformation of the sixteenth century, embodying these
erroneous principles which were adopted by the founders of most
of the Protestant churches, and which soon proved not less fatal
to the cause of scriptural truth than to the internal peace of
the Christian communities.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The first Presbyterian church was founded in Geneva by John
Calvin, about <span class="smcap">a.d.</span> 1541, and the
system afterwards introduced into Scotland, with modifications by
John Knox, about the year 1560, but not <i>legally</i>
established there till <a name="page107"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 107</span>1592.&nbsp; It has never flourished
greatly in England, and the Unitarian doctrine has now been
almost universally received among the quondam Presbyterian
congregations.</p>
<p>The <i>theory</i> of discipline in the <span
class="smcap">Scottish Church</span> does not differ very widely
from that of the English episcopacy, but the <i>practice</i> of
the two churches, as modified by the habits of the two nations,
is totally different.&nbsp; In order to reconcile the Anglican
and Scottish confessions of faith, it would be requisite that the
Church of England should consent to suppress Articles III. VII.
XXXV. and XXXVI. also that part of Art. VI. which sanctions the
public reading of the Apocrypha, and the first clause of
Art.&nbsp; XX, attributing to the church a power to decree rites
and ceremonies, as well as authority in controversies of
faith.&nbsp; Agreeing, as the English and Scottish Churches do
<i>substantially</i> in the doctrines of the Protestant faith,
they nevertheless differ widely,</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; As to the nature of holy orders and the power of
ordination.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; As to the hierarchical constitution of the Anglican
Church.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp; As to matters of ritual, especially the use of
liturgies which the Church of Scotland rejects.</p>
<p><a name="page108"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
108</span>4.&nbsp; As to the doctrines of sacramental grace and
sacerdotal absolution, implied in the offices of the Anglican
Church.</p>
<p>5.&nbsp; As to the whole system of discipline, Ecclesiastical
Courts, &amp;c.</p>
<p>6.&nbsp; As to certain points of Calvinistic theology.</p>
<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>The <span class="smcap">Independents</span> differ from the
Presbyterians chiefly in three points, namely:</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; As to ordination, and the liberty of preaching.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; As to the political form and constitution of church
government, and the conditions of church communion.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp; As to the grounds and limits of religious
liberty.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ordination alone,&rdquo; say the Independents,
&ldquo;without the precedent consent of the Church by those who
formerly have been advanced by virtue of that power they have
received by their ordination, doth not constitute any person a
church officer, or communicate office power unto
him.&rdquo;&nbsp; The Presbyterians on the other hand deny that
the mere invitation and choice of the people could confer the
pastoral office, or that it was even a pre-requisite.&nbsp; The
Independents <a name="page109"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
109</span>seem to have identified the ministerial function with
the pastoral office; and argued that it was absurd to ordain an
officer without a province to exercise the office in.&nbsp; Their
opponents viewed the Christian ministry more as an order invested
with certain inherent powers; a faculty or profession endowed
with peculiar privileges, the admission into which required to be
jealously guarded; and this power and authority they conceive
could be transmitted by those of the order.&nbsp; All approved
candidates for the ministerial office among the Presbyterians,
are ordained without reference to any local change; among the
Independents no probationer is ordained till he has been
appointed to the pastoral office.&nbsp; The first Independent or
Congregational Church in England was established by a Mr. Jacob,
<span class="smcap">a.d.</span> 1616, though it is asserted that
a Mr. Robinson was the founder of this sect, of which Dr. John
Owen, Dr. Isaac Watts, Dr. Doddridge, and Job Orton were
members.</p>
<p>The following extracts are from the discourses of Robert Hall,
who, though a Baptist, dissented from most of his brethren on the
subject of strict communion.&nbsp; He was a preacher both of
Baptist and Independent congregations, but he did not hesitate to
avow that &ldquo;he had <a name="page110"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 110</span>more fellowship of feeling for an
Independent or a Presbyterian than for a close communion
Baptist.&rdquo;&nbsp; His system of theological tenets was on the
model of what has come to be denominated &ldquo;Moderate
Calvinism.&rdquo;&nbsp; With regard to the distinctive
Calvinistic doctrine of Predestination, &ldquo;I cannot,&rdquo;
says his biographer, &ldquo;answer for the precise terms in which
he would have stated it, but I presume he would have accepted
those employed by the Church of England.&nbsp; In preaching he
very rarely made any express reference to that
doctrine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jesus Christ did not come, let it be remembered, to
establish a mere external morality, that his followers might be
screened from human laws and human justice, for human laws will
take care of this.&nbsp; The holy institution of Christianity has
a nobler object, that of purifying our hearts and regulating our
behaviour by the love of God.&nbsp; In the most practical
accounts of the proceedings of the last day given in the
Scriptures, the excellency which is represented as being a
criterion and distinguishing feature of the disciple of Christ,
and which He will acknowledge, is: Christian
benevolence&mdash;love to man manifested in the relief of the
poor.&nbsp; The Apostle St. John has given us a most sublime
description <a name="page111"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
111</span>of the love of God, when he says, &lsquo;God is
love;&rsquo; love is not so much an attribute of His nature as
His <i>very essence</i>; the spirit of Himself.&nbsp; Christian
benevolence is not only the &lsquo;image of God,&rsquo; but is
peculiarly an imitation of Christ.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;I do not
ask, my brethren, what particular virtue you have, but <i>how
much are you under the influence of Him</i>? for just so much
virtue we have, as we have of His spirit and
character.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Our Saviour places the acceptance
of men, not upon their dispositions, but upon their actions; upon
what <i>they have done</i>, not upon what they have <i>merely
believed</i> or <i>felt</i>, or in any undefined state of
mind.&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;I am persuaded that the cause of the
ruin of professing Christians does not arise so much from a
mistake of the doctrines of Christianity as from a low idea of
Christian morals; in abstaining from certain crimes and disorders
through fear of the loss of character and of punishment, without
reflecting on the spirit of that holy religion which we
profess.&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Christ went about doing good, not as
an <i>occasional</i> exercise, but as his <i>employment</i>; it
was the one thing which he did.&nbsp; Though possessed of
infinite power, he never employed it in resenting or retaliating
an injury.&nbsp; He was pre-eminently devout.&nbsp; His was <a
name="page112"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 112</span>an active
life; it was not the life of a solitary monk.&nbsp; That devotion
which terminates in itself is a luxury which sometimes perverts
the principles of benevolence to a pernicious purpose.&nbsp; Let
us rather recede from being called Christians than forget the
great symbol of our profession, love to one another.&rdquo;</p>

<span class="GutSmall">PARTICULAR BAPTISTS, SUB AND
SUPRALAPSARIANS, SANDEMANIANS.</span></h2>
<p>Having now given some account of the principal Calvinistic
sects, I shall conclude by mentioning a few of those less
numerous societies, which, whilst agreeing in the peculiar
doctrines of Calvin, differ upon other points.&nbsp; <span
class="smcap">The particular baptists</span>, agreeing with the
General Baptists on most other practices and doctrines, differ
from them on this.&nbsp; The separation took place in the year
1616, when a controversy on the subject of infant baptism having
arisen among the Baptists, one portion calling itself the
&ldquo;Independent Congregation&rdquo; seceded, embraced the
Calvinistic doctrine, and became the first Particular Baptists:
others, who were in general attached to the opinions of Calvin,
concerning the decrees of God and Divine Grace, were not entirely
agreed concerning the manner of explaining the doctrine of the <a
name="page114"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 114</span>Divine
decrees.&nbsp; The greater part believed that God only
<i>permitted</i> the first man to fall into transgression,
without particularly predetermining his fall: these were termed
<span class="smcap">sublapsarians</span>.&nbsp; But others again
maintained that &ldquo;God in order to exercise and display his
justice and his free mercy, had decreed from all eternity the
transgression of Adam, and so ordered the course of events, that
our first parents could not possibly avoid their fall.&nbsp;
These were termed <span class="smcap">supralapsarians</span>.</p>
<p>There is a modern sect that originated in Scotland about 1728,
termed Glassites, from its founder Mr. John Glass, who was
expelled by the Synod from the Church of Scotland, for
maintaining that &ldquo;the kingdom of Christ was not of this
world.&rdquo;&nbsp; His adherents then formed themselves into
churches, conformable in their institution and discipline to what
they apprehended to be the plan of the first churches recorded in
the New Testament.&nbsp; Soon after the year 1755, Mr. John
Sandeman (an elder in one of these congregations in Scotland)
attempted to prove that &ldquo;Faith is neither more nor less
than a simple assent to the Divine testimony, concerning Jesus
Christ delivered for the offences of men and raised again for
their <a name="page115"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
115</span>justification, as recorded in the New
Testament.&rdquo;&nbsp; He also mentioned that the word
<i>Faith</i> or <i>Belief</i>, is constantly used by the Apostles
to signify what is denoted by it in common conversation, i.e. a
persuasion of the truth of any proposition, and that there is no
difference between believing any common testimony, and believing
the apostolic testimony, except that which results from the
testimony itself, and the Divine authority on which it
rests.&nbsp; This led to controversy among the Calvinists and
Sandemanians, concerning the nature of justifying faith; and the
latter formed themselves into a separate sect.&nbsp; They
administer the sacrament of the Lord&rsquo;s supper weekly, and
hold &ldquo;love feasts,&rdquo; of which every member is not only
allowed but required to partake, and which consists of their
dining together at each other&rsquo;s houses, in the interval
between the morning and afternoon service.&nbsp; They interpret
literally the precept respecting the &ldquo;kiss of
charity,&rdquo; which they use on the admission of a new member,
as well as on other occasions, when they deem it necessary or
proper: they make a weekly collection before the sacrament of the
Lord&rsquo;s supper; use mutual exhortation; abstain from blood
and things strangled; wash each other&rsquo;s feet; hold that
every <a name="page116"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
116</span>one is to consider all that he possesses to be liable
to the calls of the poor and the church, and that it is unlawful
to &ldquo;lay up treasure upon earth,&rdquo; by setting them
apart for any future use.&nbsp; They allow of public and private
diversions, so far as they are not connected with circumstances
really sinful; but apprehending a lot to be sacred, they
disapprove of lotteries, playing at cards, dice, &amp;c.&nbsp;
They maintain the necessity of a plurality of elders, pastors, or
bishops in each church, and the necessity of the presence of two
elders in every act of discipline, and at the administration of
the Lord&rsquo;s supper.&nbsp; Second marriages disqualify for
the office of elder.&nbsp; The elders are ordained by prayer and
fasting, imposition of hands, and giving the &ldquo;right hand of
fellowship.&rdquo;&nbsp; In their discipline they are strict and
severe, and in every transaction esteem unanimity to be
absolutely necessary.</p>

<span class="GutSmall">CALVINISTIC METHODISTS.&nbsp; EVANGELICAL
OR SERIOUS CHRISTIANS.</span></h2>
<p>I noticed the name of George Whitfield when speaking of Wesley
and his followers, for during a time they acted in unison;
Whitfield, however, soon embraced the Calvinistic tenets, and
then the friends separated with much of unkindly feeling.&nbsp;
Wesley held the doctrines of Calvin in abhorrence, as altogether
unchristian and unfounded in Scripture.&nbsp; &ldquo;I defy you
to say so hard a thing of the Devil,&rdquo; said he with
characteristic earnestness, when speaking of the notion that God
could arbitrarily create any for eternal reprobation.&nbsp; This
separation between the leaders soon extended to their
congregations, and from that time Calvinistic and Wesleyan
Methodists became distinct sects, differing, however, but little
on any other point, excepting in the greater tendency to
enthusiasm among the followers of Whitfield.</p>
<p><a name="page118"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
118</span>&ldquo;Wesley and Whitfield,&rdquo; says Mr. Sidney in
his life of Rowland Hill, &ldquo;were men of widely different
characters, both in respect to their natural dispositions as well
as the discipline of their minds; and painful frailties were
visible in the midst of their true greatness.&nbsp; An ambitious
love of power was evidently the besetting weakness of John
Wesley; aspiration to the <i>honours</i> when he had no prospect
of the <i>suffering</i> of martyrdom, was that of
Whitfield.&rdquo;&nbsp; In his letters to Rowland Hill, it is
evident how he courted and enjoyed persecution; and whenever
&ldquo;<i>the fire</i> (to use his own expression) was kindled in
the country;&rdquo; he was not satisfied unless
&ldquo;honoured&rdquo; by being scorched a little in its
flame.&nbsp; This was a wrong spirit, and did injury to his own
mind, and to his followers, by encouraging a morose and morbid
carriage towards the world, giving needless offence, and
provoking animosity in those who might have been attracted and
endeared to truth by the lovely graces of pure
Christianity.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At the time when he, and his early friends the Wesleys began
their ministry, the piety of all classes was at a very low
ebb.&nbsp; The earnestness of these men gave a new impulse to
religious feeling, and after a time a considerable <a
name="page119"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 119</span>number of
other episcopally ordained ministers of the church, together with
a portion of the laity, became influenced by the same
sentiments.&nbsp; Without seceding, they formed a party in the
church, leaning to Calvinism to the extent they thought justified
by the <span class="smcap">xxxix</span> Articles; and this party
soon became designated by several distinguishing terms.&nbsp;
They called themselves <i>Evangelical</i> first, afterwards when
that became a cant term of misapplied reproach, they took the
title of <i>Serious</i> Christians, and by others were called
<i>Low Church</i>, and <i>Methodistical</i>.&nbsp; Besides
distinguishing themselves by an especial name, they avoided
public amusements, used a peculiar phraseology, and seemed to
delight in wearing their religion externally in the sight of all
men, thinking perhaps to reform the thoughtless by the example of
their greater strictness.&nbsp; But herein, in my opinion, they
made a net for their own feet, for that very aspiration after
greater exaltation which is implanted in us as a spur to strive
after glory and immortality, is soon by mismanagement perverted
into a love of earthly distinction.&nbsp; Hence comes ambition;
but the ambition for worldly honours has in it this alleviation,
that the man who toils after a title or a fortune, knows that he
is, after all, <a name="page120"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
120</span>seeking but a mean object; and if ever his mind is
awakened at all to a sense of the world to come, the soul springs
back to its true ambition, and launches into the career natural
to it: but the man who seeks to be distinguished among his
brethren for superior holiness, and wears it externally, that it
may be seen and honoured by men, blinds his better nature, and
fetters it to earth by chains forged in heaven; he sees not that
he is ambitious; he is not aware that while seeking, as he
imagines, to honour God in his life, he is enjoying at his
heart&rsquo;s core the respectful homage of men; and whilst
attending to his outward deportment, and making a display even of
his humility, he too frequently leaves the inner heart
unchastened.&nbsp; Our Saviour knew the frailties of man, and his
injunction that our religion should chiefly be manifested by our
benevolent feelings towards our fellow creatures, while the
communing with God should be carried on in silence and secrecy,
is the only safe guide in these matters.</p>
<p>I have no doubt that there are many of the Low Church party,
whose conscientiousness sets at defiance the dangers of the
system they have adopted: indeed my own private friendships
warrant <a name="page121"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
121</span>me in saying so: but it is not well to lead others into
dangerous paths where our own skill indeed may enable us to walk
safely, but where the hindmost, whom we are not leading by the
hand, are in continual hazard of deviating from the true course;
and therefore whilst honouring individual virtues, I continue to
consider the whole system erroneous: one whose tendency is to
create spiritual pride, and lower the standard of Christian
benevolence by restricting to a party that fellowship which
should be universal.&nbsp; It does but substitute the excitement
of the crowded church where a popular preacher charms with all
the graces of rhetoric, of the committee room, of the speakers at
Exeter Hall, for the ball room and the theatre; with this
difference, that in the first case the instinct which makes the
mind seek this excitement, is overlooked; the man believes
himself performing a meritorious action, and looks with some
contempt on his weaker brethren, who cannot exist without worldly
amusements; on the other he knows what he is about, and if he be
well-intentioned, guards against excess.&nbsp; It would be wiser
therefore to acknowledge the instinct; not bad in itself, for God
implanted it, and if it be denied a due indulgence, <a
name="page122"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 122</span>the mind
sinks into hopeless imbecility; and not to blame those who seek
other, but innocent means of gratifying it. <a

<p>The extracts that I am about to give, from the writings of two
men of note, in that party, distinguished also for their genuine
Christian feeling, will show that they saw the dangers I have
pointed out, and were anxious to guard against them.&nbsp; The
following extracts are given in Mr. Sidney&rsquo;s &ldquo;Life of
the Rev. Rowland Hill.&rdquo; <a name="citation122b"></a><a

affectionate, and experimental applications.&nbsp; Oh! &rsquo;tis
most pleasant to love one another with pure hearts
fervently.&nbsp; Love is of God, for &lsquo;God is
love.&rsquo;&nbsp; The summit of our happiness must be the
perfection of our holiness.&nbsp; By this blessed grace we have
the brightest evidence that we are &lsquo;born of
God.&rsquo;&nbsp; If we allow that little shades of difference
may exist, we ought to &lsquo;love as brethren,&rsquo; and where
Christian candour and love are found to reign, the odious sin of
schism, according to its general interpretation, cannot
exist.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;It is no sign that we value the
blessings of God, if we can part with them&rdquo; (i.e. dear
friends) &ldquo;without regret.&nbsp; That mind is badly framed
that prefers stoical indifference to Christian sensibility, and
though the pain is abundantly more acute where those finer
feelings of the mind are found to exist; yet who deserves the
name of a human being who is without them?&rdquo;&nbsp; <a
name="page124"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
124</span>&ldquo;While a soul within our reach is ignorant of a
Saviour, we must endeavour to win it to Christ.&nbsp; How weary I
am of a great deal of what is called the &lsquo;<i>religious
world</i>!&rsquo;&nbsp; High and Low Church Sectarianism seems to
be the order of the day; we are much more busy in contending for
<i>parties</i> than for <i>principles</i>.&nbsp; These evils are
evidences of a lack of genuine Christianity.&nbsp; Oh! when shall
that happy day dawn upon us, when real Christians and Christian
ministers of all denominations shall come nearer to each
other.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The next extracts shall be from the writings of one who was
scarcely appreciated by the world in general, but of whose
excellencies I was enabled to judge, during my residence at
Cambridge; Mr. Simeon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Religion appears in its true colours when it regulates
our conduct in social life; your religion must be seen, not in
the church, or in the closet only, but in the shop, the family,
the field: it must mortify pride and every other evil passion,
and must bring faith into exercise.&nbsp; Try yourselves by this
standard: see what you are as husbands or wives, parents or
children, masters or servants.&rdquo; <a
name="citation124"></a><a href="#footnote124"
class="citation">[124]</a></p>
<p><a name="page125"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
125</span>&ldquo;The self-righteous, self-applauding moralist can
spy out the failings and infirmities of those who profess a
stricter system of religion; but let me ask such an one,
&lsquo;Are there not in thee, even in thee, sins against the Lord
thy God?&rsquo;&nbsp; Verily if thou wouldst consult thy own
conscience, thou wouldst see little reason, and feel little
inclination too, to cast stones at others.&nbsp; Professors of
religion also are but too guilty of this same fault, being filled
with an overweening conceit of their own excellencies, and a
contemptuous disregard of their less spiritual neighbours.&nbsp;
But I would ask the professed follower of Christ, Are there not
sins with thee too as well as with the pharisaic formalist?&nbsp;
Are there not great and crying evils in the religious world,
which prove a stumbling block to those around them?&nbsp; Are
there not often found among professors of religion the same
covetous desires, the same fraudulent practices, the same
deviations from truth and honour, as are found in persons who
make no profession?&nbsp; Are there not many whose tempers are so
unsubdued, that they make their whole families a scene of
contention and misery?&nbsp; Yes!&nbsp; Though the accusations
which are brought against the whole body of religious people as
&lsquo;hypocrites,&rsquo; are a gross <a name="page126"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 126</span>calumny, there is but too much
ground for them in the conduct of many.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;Nothing is more common, and nothing more delusive than a
noisy, talkative religion.&nbsp; True religion is a humble,
silent, retired thing; not affecting public notice, but rather
wishing to approve itself to God.&nbsp; It is not in
<i>saying</i> &lsquo;Lord, Lord!&rsquo; but in <i>doing</i> the
will of our heavenly Father, that we shall find acceptance at the
last day.&nbsp; Happy would it be if many who place all their
religion in running about and hearing sermons, and talking of the
qualifications of ministers, would attend to this hint, and
endeavour to acquire more of that wisdom which evinces its Divine
origin by the excellence of its fruits.&rdquo; <a

<h2><a name="page127"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
127</span>LETTER X.<br />
<span class="GutSmall">ON ROMANISM AND CEREMONIAL
RELIGION.</span></h2>
<p>I promised that as the completion of my task, I would notice
those differences which have occurred in the bosom of the church
itself, even though they can scarcely be called <i>sects</i>; I
therefore propose to conclude my correspondence with a short
survey of the above-named, which I think should rather be viewed
as the working out of great principles, than as parties
distinguished by particular creeds or opinions on abstract
subjects.&nbsp; I may run counter to some prejudices, perhaps, in
so doing; but the truth is well worth running a tilt
for:&mdash;you may sit by as umpire, and decide when I have done,
whether I have carried my spear in a knightly fashion.</p>
<p>Though I shall not think it necessary, like Racine&rsquo;s
advocate in Les Plaideurs, to go back to the Assyrians and the
Babylonians to illustrate my proposition, yet I must begin from a
<a name="page128"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 128</span>very
distant period, in order to make my views thoroughly
comprehensible.&nbsp; I must therefore beg you to notice that the
tendency of man&rsquo;s mind always is, and always has been,
towards the visible and the tangible.&nbsp; The pure abstraction
of a Governing Will without any perceptible presence, has in it
something too remote from the common habits, powers, and feelings
of human nature, ever to be thoroughly embraced by the heart of
man; and we find that the Deity has always condescended so far to
the weakness of his creatures, as to give the imagination some
resting place.&nbsp; Thus the patriarch had his altar of
sacrifice, where the fire from heaven marked the present
Deity&mdash;and the Israelite had first the pillar of the cloud,
and then the tabernacle, where the mysterious Shechinah dwelt
over the mercy seat.&nbsp; Yet even this indistinct
representation of an embodied Deity, did not satisfy the people:
they required a <i>form</i>, tangible, visible, and Aaron yielded
to the wish; because he thought it a prudent and allowable
compliance with the weakness of human nature.&nbsp; He was wrong,
and was punished for it; and this transaction we shall find the
type and foreshadowing of every thing that has since happened in
the world with regard to religion.&nbsp; <a
name="page129"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 129</span>The
Almighty gives man just enough to rest his thoughts upon: it is
the fire on the altar, the cloud, the temple, and last of all
<i>the man</i>, in whom our devotion may find also an object of
affection: but he requires that we shall not go beyond
this.&nbsp; We must not return to earth, and make for ourselves a
worship less spiritual than he has instituted; on the contrary,
he requires us to pierce through the veil as we advance in
knowledge, and discern the spiritual through the visible.&nbsp;
Hence the perpetual denunciations of the prophets against the
Jews for their adherence to forms, which latterly they did adhere
to, instead of giving attention to the purification of their
hearts.</p>
<p>Among all but the Israelites, the progress of the tangible was
much more rapid: idolatry, with all its gross rites, had
established itself among <i>the people</i>, at any rate, in
Egypt, at a very early period; and spread from that old and
luxurious empire, through the more simple states which sprang up
around and from it.&nbsp; The Exodus was a warning from on high,
that there was a Being, unseen and intangible, whose fiat
governed all things: and this lesson was not wholly without
fruit: yet still the human race reverted to the objects of the
senses, till, in <a name="page130"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
130</span>God&rsquo;s good time, he sent his Son: presented a
tangible form on which the mind could dwell&mdash;then removed it
from the earth, and said, &ldquo;You may now think on this, and
give your imagination a resting place: this form you shall see
again; but in mean time you must purify your hearts from earthly
desires: that form will only greet your eyes when you have cast
off the burthen of the flesh, and have entered upon a spiritual
existence.&rdquo;&nbsp; The first Christians remembered and loved
the man; his precepts, his example, his smallest words or actions
were recurred to with the fondness of personal friendship; and
this carried Christianity through the first two centuries; but
then this remembrance began to have a character of abstraction,
and again the human heart called for tangibility.&nbsp; Then
came, step by step, gorgeous ceremonies, pictures,
representations of the personal presence and sufferings of the
Saviour.&nbsp; The very requirements of those who quitted the
splendid and sensual rites of heathenism for the faith of Christ,
led the Christian doctors to endeavour to replace the festival of
the idol by something analogous in the Christian church: and thus
without well knowing what they were tending to, the heads of the
church yielded one point of <a name="page131"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 131</span>spiritualism after another; sought
to captivate and awe the people by impressive ceremonies; and
finished by the sin of Aaron: they set up the image and said,
&ldquo;These be thy Gods, O Israel! that brought thee out of the
land of Egypt.&rdquo; <a name="citation131a"></a><a
href="#footnote131a" class="citation">[131a]</a>&nbsp; For be it
observed here, that Aaron set up this image merely as a tangible
representation of the true Deity; <i>a help to the devotion of
the people</i>, who could not worship without seeing
something.</p>
<p>This then is Romanism; it is not transubstantiation, nor the
mediation of the Virgin and the Saints, <a
name="citation131b"></a><a href="#footnote131b"
class="citation">[131b]</a> nor the infallibility of popes and
councils; these are natural consequences indeed, but the
distinctive character of the Romish church is
<i>tangibility</i>.&nbsp; &ldquo;There is the actual
flesh,&rdquo; it says, &ldquo;there is the representation of the
actual human presence of saints and martyrs; there is the actual
man enthroned, who represents the power of God:&rdquo; but it
might have fifty other ways of satisfying this restless craving
of the human mind, and it would be equally pernicious in any of
these forms.&nbsp; Man&rsquo;s great struggle has always been
between the animal <a name="page132"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
132</span>and the spiritual nature, and when religion goes one
step farther towards tangibility than the Deity himself has
allowed, the animal nature gains strength; and vice and
licentiousness follow as naturally, among the mass of the people,
as rain follows the cloud.</p>
<p>Observe, I do not here deny that many may profess a religion
of sense, and remain spiritually-minded themselves: Heathenism
had its Socrates, its Xenocrates, &amp;c.&mdash;Romanism has its
Pascal, its Fenelon, and a train of other great names: but look
at the <i>people</i> during that period, and the account will be
very different.&nbsp; When an ignorant man imagines that he can
remove the Divine anger by a sacrifice or a penance, he avoids
the trouble of curbing his passions, and compounds, as he thinks,
for indulgence of the one, by the performance of the other; but
when he is told that purity of life and thought is the only road
to Divine favour, if he sins, he sins at least with some feelings
of compunction, some dread that he may not have it in his power
to remove the stain he is incurring.&nbsp; The preaching of
Wesley reformed multitudes, all enthusiastic as it was; but it
would be difficult to find a parallel in the annals of
Romanism.&nbsp; As great a movement of the public <a
name="page133"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 133</span>mind was
made by the preaching of Peter the Hermit; but how different was
the object and the result!&nbsp; The personal pilgrimage to the
Holy Sepulchre, as a mode of wiping out sin, was undertaken by
thousands, who perished miserably, or, if they lived, came back
not better men than they went: under a system of less
tangibility, and a preaching as effective, they might have staid
in their homes, and glorified God by a life such as Christ came
to teach and to exemplify.</p>
<p>It is so much easier to make a pilgrimage, or endure a long
fast, than to subdue and tame the animal nature till it becomes
obedient to the rational will, and seconds instead of resisting
its wishes, that it is not surprising that in all ages a religion
of outward observance should be more popular than one of inward
purification.&nbsp; Those even which set off with the highest
pretensions in this way have degenerated, and the outward and
visible form is too often substituted for the inward and
spiritual grace, which it was intended to <i>represent</i> not to
<i>supersede</i>.&nbsp; That religion therefore has the best
chance of influencing the soul, which, as far as is possible,
renounces outward demonstrations which human indolence is so glad
to rely on, and preaches <a name="page134"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 134</span>boldly and effectually the
uselessness of ceremonies, farther than as they tend to preserve
the remembrance of <span class="smcap">Him</span> who came to
call the world back to <span class="smcap">Himself</span>, to
trample on the sensual and the animal, and to raise man to his
pristine, or rather, to what is to be his future state.&nbsp; A
public acknowledgment of Christ as our Master and Lord, and a
compliance with his own few and simple ordinances; are all that
Christian duty requires, and nearly as much as Christian prudence
will permit.&nbsp; The rest is a matter of worldly expediency,
and should be so regarded.</p>
<p>No doubt rests on my own mind&mdash;I leave others to think as
they may&mdash;that Episcopacy was the established form of the
Church as soon as the Christian communities began to assume
enough of regularity to admit of any settled order; and I think
it a wise form.&nbsp; As far as any institution can, it secures
unity and decency in the church: and as far as any institution
can, that was not positively established by Christ himself, it
possesses, in my mind, the sanction of antiquity.&nbsp; It gives
the concentration of purpose and regularity of effort which is
bestowed by the discipline of an army; for as in an army a
detachment acts upon the same system of tactics, <a
name="page135"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 135</span>and obeys
officers constituted by the same authority, and thus assists the
efforts of the main body, and falls into rank with it when they
meet; so the church, under such a form, may send detachments to
the ends of the earth, who may meet after long years, as brothers
of the same communion, and find that though the individuals have
passed away, others have stepped into their place in the ranks,
and are teaching what their predecessors taught.&nbsp; The
benefit of church discipline, therefore, in my mind is great; but
I do not suppose that salvation depends on it, because God has
repeatedly declared that Christ died <i>for all</i>, <a
name="citation135a"></a><a href="#footnote135a"
class="citation">[135a]</a> and that he is not willing that any
should perish; <a name="citation135b"></a><a href="#footnote135b"
class="citation">[135b]</a> consequently he can hardly have made
our eternal state dependent on what no man can accomplish for
himself.&nbsp; A person may not have it in his power to receive
baptism from an ordained priest, but he may live as Christ
taught; or, having never heard of Christ even, he may, like the
gentiles, win glory and immortality, <a
name="citation135c"></a><a href="#footnote135c"
class="citation">[135c]</a> if, having not the law, he be a law
unto himself.&nbsp; I would not receive Christ&rsquo;s ordinances
from the hands of any but an ordained <a name="page136"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 136</span>priest, myself, because if a doubt
exist in my mind, I sin in doing the doubtful thing; but herein I
speak only for myself; let every man do as he is &ldquo;persuaded
in his mind&rdquo; <a name="citation136"></a><a
href="#footnote136" class="citation">[136]</a> in matters of
secondary import, as all ceremonial matters must be.</p>
<p>You will now be prepared for my opinion with regard to the
late movement made in the church by the Anglo-Catholics, as they
term themselves; Puseyites, or Newmanites, as they have been
termed by others.&nbsp; They have been thought to have introduced
innovations&mdash;they have not:&mdash;there is not one of the
ceremonies or practices which they have recommended, which was
not very early practised in the church; but it was from the undue
importance attached to these ceremonies, which came to be
regarded with reverence from having been instituted by apostles
and martyrs, that the after growth of Roman superstition sprang
up so rankly.&nbsp; I believe the first promoters of this
movement were as remote from actual Romanism as I am, when they
first began it; but when once reason is submitted to any human
dictum, in matters of religion, there is no resting place <a
name="page137"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 137</span>till we
arrive at the &ldquo;infallible&rdquo; guide which the Romish
church claims to be.&nbsp; There alone can the soul which will
not think for itself, find a ready and confident director.&nbsp;
Accordingly, we find that some of those very men who but a few
years back exposed the errors of Romanism, have now yielded
themselves blindfold to the guidance of that very church, which,
as long as they allowed themselves to reason, they acknowledged
to have departed from the truth.&nbsp; Yet it is perhaps
fortunate for the people generally, that this declension of its
pastors has been as rapid and complete as it has been:&mdash;they
were going back towards the sin of Aaron&mdash;they were
insisting on ceremonies as necessary to salvation, thus rendering
religion gross and tangible, and the people thus taught would
soon have forgotten what those ceremonies were intended to
represent, and have depended for salvation on what could not
avail them in the hour of need: for the repetition of prayer is
not necessarily praying, nor is the reception of the eucharist
necessarily sanctification, though these may be the outward and
visible signs of the inward and spiritual grace which is working
in the heart.&nbsp; Once teach a man that <i>any</i> ceremony is
<i>requisite</i> to salvation, and he will soon <a
name="page138"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 138</span>go a step
further by himself, and think the outward ceremony sufficient
without the inward grace.&nbsp; This indeed is but a necessary
corollary; for if the ceremony be requisite to salvation, then
the inward grace working purity of life, avails not without the
ceremony; and thus purity of life is no longer a substantive
virtue; it cannot stand alone; and the prop which it requires
being so very strong, why should not the prop itself be all in
all?&nbsp; This will be the course of ratiocination in the mind
of the mass of mankind, whether avowed or not; and however the
promoters of a ceremonial religion may shrink from such a
consequence, it is so certain, as all experience shows, that they
might as well throw a man who cannot swim into the water, and
recommend him not to drown, as give a half instructed man a
ceremony, which he is told is requisite to salvation, and expect
that he will not cling to that, as the more convenient and least
difficult observance; and whilst perfect in complying with every
ordinance of the church, forget that he has overlooked the
weightier matters of the law&mdash;judgment, justice, and
mercy.</p>
<p>This may sound harsh, but it is true; and I appeal to the calm
judgment even of the excellent <a name="page139"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 139</span>Dr. Pusey himself, who has so
unintentionally drawn many into a course from which, haply, he
would now gladly draw them back, whether it be not so?&nbsp; His
learning will show him how, through all ages, the spiritualism
taught from heaven, has been counteracted by the visible and the
tangible contrived by man; and in the step from the patriarchal
religion, to the idolatry of Greece and Rome; from Christianity
as preached by Christ and his Apostles, to the gross
superstitions of the twelfth, thirteenth, and fourteenth
centuries, he may see a type of what would be the consequence of
again enforcing a ceremonial religion.</p>

Testament means <i>affectionate regard</i>.&nbsp; The distinction
between charity and almsgiving is well laid down by St. Clement

to the sharing our good things with others; but this is not in
itself charity, but only our outward sign of that

religious differences could hinder our Saviour from doing
good.&nbsp; We should consider that men&rsquo;s understandings
naturally are not all of the same size and capacity, and that
this difference is greatly increased by different education,
different employments, different company, and the like.&nbsp; No
man is infallible.&nbsp; We are liable to errors perhaps as much
as others.&nbsp; The very best men may sometimes differ in
opinion, as St. Paul &lsquo;withstood St. Peter to the
face;&rsquo; and if there was such a difference between two of
the chiefest of the Apostles, well may there be between inferior
mortals.&nbsp; About modes of faith there will always be dispute

persecutions in the world, all the penalties and inflictions upon
those who differ from ourselves, however conscientiously, take
their rise from an imperfect and erroneous notion of what really
constitutes the glory of God, and the manner in which we best can
assist its display and extension.&nbsp; The angels at the birth
of Christ sang that the glory of God was in unison with
&lsquo;Peace on earth, and good will towards
men.&rsquo;&mdash;&lsquo;No!&rsquo; said the Schoolman,

think.&rsquo;&mdash;&lsquo;No!&rsquo; said the Inquisitor,

prescribe.&rsquo;&mdash;&lsquo;No!&rsquo; said the Covenanters,
&lsquo;the glory of God consists in exterminating those whom we
call his enemies.&rsquo;&nbsp; Mistaken men! who <i>thus</i>
propose to honour the God and Father of the universe, the
merciful God, and the gracious Father of all his rational
creatures!&nbsp; Instead of perusing with delight and conviction
the plain declaration contained in our Sacred records, too many
Christians have in almost every age passed over the
characteristics of kind design throughout nature: they have
mistaken or forgotten the clear delineations of Divine Mercy and
Goodness in the Book of Grace, and have had recourse to the
narrowed circle of their own

pleasures; and unless care be taken, the sermon of the church or
chapel will be neutralized by the association of the tavern and
the raceground.&nbsp; There must be safety valves for the mind,

unreservedly arise, and thank our Maker; those pursuits which mar
our devotions, and render us unwilling or afraid to come before
Him, cannot be innocent.&nbsp; It would be no easy matter to lay
down, as applicable to all, a rule as to how far conformity with
the world is admissible, and where the Christian must stop: for
as the habits and tempers and propensities of men differ, so also
do their temptations and their danger.&nbsp; Thus through the

<p>Order for the administration of the Lord&rsquo;s Supper.&nbsp;
Confession, the same as in the liturgy of the English church as
far as &ldquo;we do heartily repent and are heartily sorry for
these our misdoings, the remembrance of which is grievous unto
us.&nbsp; Have mercy upon us, have mercy upon us, most merciful
Father; forgive us all that is past: and grant that we may ever
hereafter serve and please thee in newness of life to the honour
and glory of thy name.&rdquo;&nbsp; The absolution is the same
with the trifling change of <i>us</i> for <i>you</i>.&nbsp; The
sentences following are the same till &ldquo;Hear also what St.
John saith,&rdquo; where the text 1 John i. 8, 9, is
substituted.</p>
<p>Prayer before the minister receives the communion.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Almighty God, our heavenly Father, by whose gracious
assistance and for our benefit, thy beloved Son our Lord Jesus
Christ, was obedient even to the death upon the cross; who did
institute, and in his holy gospel command us to continue, a
perpetual memorial of his death until his coming again; hear us,
we most humbly beseech thee; and grant that we may receive this
bread and wine in grateful remembrance of his death and
sufferings, and of thy great mercy to mankind in sending him, thy
chosen messenger, to turn us from darkness to light, from vice to
virtue, from ignorance and error to the knowledge of thee, the
only true God, whom to know is life everlasting.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Form of administration.&nbsp; &ldquo;Take and eat this bread
in remembrance of Christ&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Take and drink this
wine in remembrance of Christ.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the daily service many prayers are omitted, so as to make
the service much shorter.&nbsp; The exhortation and confession
are the same; for the absolution is substituted &ldquo;Almighty
God, unto whom all hearts are open, all desires known and from
whom no secrets are hid; purify the thoughts of our hearts that
we may perfectly love thee, and worthily magnify thy holy name
through Christ our Lord.&rdquo;&mdash;It would be useless to
multiply extracts&mdash;enough has been given to show the
doctrine of the Unitarian congregations who use this liturgy.</p>

eight o&rsquo;clock, my mistress seeing her sons set off, and
knowing they were gone to a Methodist meeting, determined to
prevent me from doing the same, by locking the door; on which in
a superstitious mood I opened the Bible for direction what to do,
and the first words I read were these, &ldquo;He shall give his
angels charge concerning thee, lest at any time thou dash thy
foot against a stone.&rdquo;&nbsp; This was enough for me, so
without a moment&rsquo;s hesitation I ran up two pair of stairs
to my own room, and out of the window I leapt to the great terror
of my poor mistress.&nbsp; My feet and ancles were most
intolerably bruised, so that I was obliged to be put to bed; and
it was more than a month before I recovered the use of my
limbs.&nbsp; I was then ignorant enough to think that <i>the Lord
had not used me very well</i>; and I resolved <i>not to put so
much trust in him</i> for the future.&nbsp; My rash adventure
made a great noise in the town, and was talked of many miles
round.&nbsp; Some few admired my prodigious strength of faith;
but the major part pitied me as a poor ignorant, deluded, and
infatuated boy.&rdquo;</p>

with each other, appear incompatible; in such cases the main
drift of the writer must always be considered; for it is much
more usual to fail in expressing our meaning than to express
contradictory opinions: since the latter implies a cerebral
defect verging on insanity, the former merely results from a
faulty style.&nbsp; Scripture does not any where warrant us in
saying &ldquo;<i>the moment</i> a penitent sinner,&rdquo;
&amp;c.; but requires from us a proof of this belief by actions
conformable to it.&nbsp; God has promised us immortality through
his Son, only if we not merely believe, but &ldquo;do that which
is lawful and right.&rdquo;</p>

objection to <i>p&aelig;do</i> or infant baptism; and finally,

one of their published works: &ldquo;The first eclogue of Virgil
has always appeared to me to express most felicitously the
pleasures of a <i>pastoral</i> life as we too frequently see it
in these days.&nbsp; With what force the following lines describe
the grateful feeling of a <i>young clergyman</i>, who is
recounting the benefits conferred on him by his patron:</p>
<blockquote><p>O Melib&oelig;e, Deus nobis h&aelig;c otia
fecit.<br />
Namque erit ille mihi semper Deus&mdash;<br />
Ille meas errare boves, ut cernis, et ipsum<br />
Ludere, q&aelig;e vellem, calamo permisit agresti.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>My patron shall always be a divinity to me, for he put me into
this life of ease when he gave me this <i>gem</i>, <i>the
prettiest living in England</i>.&nbsp; He gave me this <i>easy
duty</i>, so that I can let my flock wander wheresoever it may
please them, as you see they do; while I myself do just what 1
like, and occasionally amuse myself with a <i>pianoforte</i> by
Stoddart, that cost eighty-five guineas.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He (the congregational minister) is now, in his own
opinion, the <span class="smcap">one man</span> of the whole body
of believers in all the services of the sanctuary.&nbsp; He
utters all their sentiments of faith and doctrine, and offers up
all their prayers!&nbsp; How can he justify the position he has
assumed as <i>an usurper</i>? yea as a <i>grievous wolf</i>! in
that he has swallowed up <i>all the gifts of the Holy Ghost</i>
in the <i>voracity of his selfishness</i>,&rdquo; &amp;c.&nbsp;
It is not thus that the &ldquo;unity of the church,&rdquo; which
they profess to desire is likely to be cemented.</p>
<p><a name="footnote90"></a><a href="#citation90"
class="footnote">[90]</a>&nbsp; Bishop Jewel, in his
&ldquo;Defence of his apology for the Church of England,&rdquo;
says, that &ldquo;the term <i>Calvinist</i> was in the first
instance applied to the Reformers and the English Protestants as
a matter of reproach by the Church of Rome.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="footnote91"></a><a href="#citation91"
class="footnote">[91]</a>&nbsp; Whatever difference may have
subsisted between Luther and Calvin on the subject of Divine
decrees, no language can be stronger than that in which Luther
insists upon the moral impotence of man&rsquo;s depraved nature
in opposition to the Pelagian doctrine of freewill.</p>
<p><a name="footnote93a"></a><a href="#citation93a"
class="footnote">[93a]</a>&nbsp; It is difficult to reconcile
this doctrine with 2 Cor. v. 14, 15.&nbsp; 1 Tim. ii. 6.&nbsp; 2
Pet. iii. 9.&nbsp; Rom. viii. 32.&nbsp; 1 Tim. iv. 10.
&amp;c.</p>
<p><a name="footnote93b"></a><a href="#citation93b"
class="footnote">[93b]</a>&nbsp; The best account of their system
is to be found in &ldquo;The Assembly&rsquo;s Catechism,&rdquo;
which is taught their children.&nbsp; To this sect belongs more
particularly the doctrine of <i>Atonement</i>, or, &ldquo;that
Christ by his death made satisfaction to the Divine justice for
the <i>Elect</i>; appeasing the anger of the Divine Being, and
effecting on his part a reconciliation.&rdquo;&nbsp; That thus
Christ had, as they term it, &ldquo;the sin of the Elect laid
upon him.&rdquo;&nbsp; But some of their teachers do not hold
this opinion, but consider Christ&rsquo;s death as simply a
medium through which God has been pleased to exercise mercy
towards the penitent.&nbsp; &ldquo;The sacrifice of
Christ,&rdquo; says Dr. Magee, &ldquo;was never deemed by any
(who did not wish to calumniate the doctrine of atonement), to
have made God placable: but merely viewed as the means appointed
by Divine wisdom by which to bestow forgiveness.&rdquo;&nbsp; To
this it may be further added, that the language used throughout
the Epistles of St. Paul with regard to the redemption of man, is
that of the then familiar slave market.&nbsp; Man is
&ldquo;bought with a price&rdquo; from his former master, Sin,
for the service of God.&nbsp; The scholar who will consult Romans
vi. will see immediately that all the metaphors used are those of
purchase for military service; &ldquo;Your members,&rdquo; says
he, ver. 13, &ldquo;shall not be the arms
(&#8004;&pi;&lambda;&alpha;) of unrighteousness used for the
service of sin; but the arms (&#8004;&pi;&lambda;&alpha;) of
righteousness for God.&rdquo;&nbsp; And ver 23, &tau;&#8048;
&gamma;&#8048;&rho; &#8000;&psi;&#974;&nu;&iota;&alpha;
&tau;&#8134;&sigmaf;

&#7968;&mu;&#8182;&nu;. i.e. The rations of sin are death, but
the donative of God is eternal life, by means of Jesus Christ our
Lord.&nbsp; It is impossible to express more clearly that it was
not the wrath of God which required to be appeased by the great
sacrifice&mdash;the slave was <i>bought by Him for
Himself</i>&mdash;the price was of course paid to another.&nbsp;
Much misunderstanding has arisen from the careless interpretation
of these and the like passages, whose phraseology has become
obsolete along with the practice of buying and selling slaves, at
least in this country.</p>

having personal acquaintance with the Presbyterians of Ireland:
and such is the confusion generally made by authors between
Arianism, Socinianism, and Unitarianism, that it is difficult to
know which is meant.&nbsp; As a large proportion of the modern
Presbyterians have embraced Unitarian doctrines, it seems
improbable that the Irish should have adopted those of Arius,

of the seceders.</p>

Heber&rsquo;s mind was deeply imbued with devotional feelings, he
considered a moderate participation in what are usually called
worldly amusements, to be allowable and blameless.&nbsp;
&ldquo;He thought,&rdquo; says his biographer, &ldquo;that the
strictness which made no distinction between things blameable
only in their abuse, and the practices which were really immoral,
was prejudicial to the interests of true religion; and on this
point his opinion remained unchanged to the last.&nbsp; His own
life indeed was a proof that amusement so participated in, may be

together all the people of God wherever they could meet, and was
willing to join in a universal communion with Christians of every
name.&nbsp; When, on one occasion, he had preached in a chapel,
where none but baptized adults (i.e. baptized after attaining
years of discretion), were admitted to the sacrament, he wished

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/pglaf.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
